miR-590-5p, miR-219-5p, miR-15b and miR-628-5p are commonly regulated by IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF in acute myeloid leukemia. Aberrations in IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF induced signaling are frequently reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Herein, we utilized a unique human myeloid leukemic cell line, AML-193, which responds to all three cytokines to analyze the regulation at microRNA level. Using real-time PCR-based miRNA expression profiling, we investigated miRNA signatures regulated by IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF for n=704 miRNAs. We discovered that in addition to regulating specific miRNAs, these cytokines also regulate common set of miRNAs, which includes miR-590-5p, miR-219-5p, miR-15b and miR-628-5p. Taken together, we have identified novel candidate miRNAs that may be instructive during leukemic and normal hematopoiesis.
