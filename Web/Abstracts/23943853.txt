Human Angiotensinogen +11525 C/A Polymorphism Modulates Its Gene Expression Through MicroRNA Binding. Hypertension is a serious risk factor for myocardial infarction, heart failure, vascular disease, stroke, and renal failure. Like other complex disease, hypertension is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure. The octapeptide, angiotensin-II, is one of the most active vasopressor agents and is obtained from precursor molecule, angiotensinogen (AGT), by the combined proteolytic action of renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). AGT gene is associated with essential hypertension in Caucasians, Japanese, and Asian- Indian subjects. AGT gene may also be associated with cardiac hypertrophy, coronary atherosclerosis, and microangiopathy related cerebral damage. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the hAGT gene alter the binding of transcription factors and modulate its gene expression in human liver and kidney cells. SNPs in the promoter region of hAGT gene also affect the expression of this gene in different tissues of transgenic mice and modulate blood pressure in transgenic mice. Human AGT gene also has a C/A polymorphism at nucleoside 11525 (rs7079) which is located in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and is modestly associated with increased blood pressure. We show here that miR-31 and miR-584 bind strongly to the hAGT 3'UTR containing 11525C-allele as compared to 11525A-allele. We also show that transfection of miR-31 and miR-584 down-regulates the hAGT mRNA and protein levels in human liver cells. These studies may provide new therapeutic approach to reduce hypertension.
