miRNA expression in the failing human heart: functional correlates. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding ~22-nucleotide regulatory RNAs that are key regulators of gene expression programs. Their role in the context of the cardiovascular system has only recently begun to be explored; however, changes in the expression of miRNAs have been associated with cardiac development and with several pathophysiological states including myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. We demonstrate that miRNA expression patterns are distinct in two types of heart failure: idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy. To pursue the observation that changes in expression levels of individual miRNAs are functionally relevant, microRNA mimics and inhibitors to miR-92, miR-100 and miR-133b were expressed in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. These studies demonstrated that over-expression of miR-100 is involved in the beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated repression of &quot;adult&quot; cardiac genes (i.e., alpha-myosin heavy chain, SERCA2a), and that over-expression of miR-133b prevents changes in gene expression patterns mediated by beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. In conclusion, some miRNA expression patterns appear to be unique to the etiology of cardiomyopathy and changes in the expression level of miRs 100 and 133b contribute to regulation of the fetal gene program. It is likely that this miR-directed reprogramming of key remodeling genes is involved in the establishment and progression of common human cardiomyopathies.
