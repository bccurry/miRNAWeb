Glatiramer acetate treatment normalizes deregulated microRNA expression in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. The expression of selected microRNAs (miRNAs) known to be involved in the regulation of immune responses was analyzed in 74 patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and 32 healthy controls. Four miRNAs (miR-326, miR-155, miR-146a, miR-142-3p) were aberrantly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from RRMS patients compared to controls. Although expression of these selected miRNAs did not differ between treatment-nave (n=36) and interferon-beta treated RRMS patients (n=18), expression of miR-146a and miR-142-3p was significantly lower in glatiramer acetate (GA) treated RRMS patients (n=20) suggesting that GA, at least in part, restores the expression of deregulated miRNAs in MS.
