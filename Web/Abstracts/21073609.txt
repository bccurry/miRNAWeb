Association between common genetic variants in pre-microRNAs and gastric cancer risk in Japanese population. Common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNAs (miRNA) have been shown to be associated with susceptibility to several human cancers. We evaluated the associations of three SNPs (rs11614913, rs2910164, and rs3746444) in pre-miRNAs (miR-196a2, miR-146a, and miR-499) with the risk of gastric cancer (GC) and peptic ulcer diseases, and with the severity of Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis in Japanese population. The rs11614913 (C&gt;T), rs2910164 (G&gt;C), and rs3746444 (A&gt;G) SNPs were genotyped in 552 GC, and 697 non-cancer subjects, including 141 gastric and 73 duodenal ulcer, and 483 non-ulcer subjects. The degree of histologic gastritis was classified according to the updated Sydney System, and the serum pepsinogen levels were measured in selected 579 and 204 cases. The rs2910164 CC genotype held a significantly higher risk of GC when compared to non-cancer subjects (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.66, p =.03). Similarly, the rs2910164 C carrier was associated with higher risk of GC when compared to both non-cancer and non-ulcer subjects (OR = 1.39, 95%CI = 1.00-1.93, p =.05, adjusted OR = 1.57, 95%CI = 1.09-2.27, p =.016, respectively). The rs2910164 CC genotype was associated with non-cardia and upper third, diffuse type and advanced stage GC. The rs11614913 TT genotype was associated with higher degree of mononuclear cell infiltration (score 0-1 vs 2, adjusted OR = 1.62, 95%CI = 1.05-2.49, p =.03). The rs2910164 (G&gt;C) SNP in the miR-146a is associated with susceptibility to GC. In addition, the rs11614913 (C&gt;T) SNP in the miR-196a2 is associated with the degree of H. pylori-induced mononuclear cell infiltration.
