MicroRNA-124 suppresses oral squamous cell carcinoma motility by targeting ITGB1. Alterations in the levels of molecules which interact with the extracellular matrix, such as integrins, are associated with invasion of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). The molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulation of integrin expression in OSCC, however, remain unclear. Here, we show that microRNA-124, a small non-coding RNA down-regulated in OSCC, is able to downregulate expression of integrin beta-1 (ITGB1) by interacting with its 3' untranslated region. Over-expression of miR-124 attenuates endogenous ITGB1 expression and reduces the adherence and motility of OSCC cells, suggesting disruption of miR-124-mediated repression of ITGB1 may be a key factor in OSCC progression.
