MicroRNA-29a and microRNA-142-3p are regulators of myeloid differentiation and acute myeloid leukemia. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly linked to various physiologic processes, including hematopoiesis, their function in the myeloid development is poorly understood. We detected up-regulation of miR-29a and miR-142-3p during myeloid differentiation in leukemia cell lines and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. By gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrated that both miRNAs promote the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced monocytic and all-trans-retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60, THP-1, or NB4 cells. Both the miRNAs directly inhibited cyclin T2 gene, preventing the release of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma and resulting in induction of monocytic differentiation. In addition, a target of miR-29a, cyclin-dependent kinase 6 gene, and a target of miR-142-3p, TGF--activated kinase 1/MAP3K7 binding protein 2 gene, are involved in the regulation of both monocytic and granulocytic differentiation. A significant decrease of miR-29a and 142-3p levels and an obvious increase in their target protein levels were also observed in blasts from acute myeloid leukemia. By lentivirus-mediated gene transfer, we demonstrated that enforced expression of either miR-29a or miR-142-3p in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from healthy controls and acute myeloid leukemia patients down-regulated expression of their targets and promoted myeloid differentiation. These findings confirm that miR-29a and miR-142-3p are key regulators of normal myeloid differentiation and their reduced expression is involved in acute myeloid leukemia development.
