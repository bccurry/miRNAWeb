Clinical significance of miR-155 expression in breast cancer and effects of miR-155 ASO on cell viability and apoptosis. Accumulating evidence shows that mircroRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in tumorigenesis. miR-155 is one of the most multifunctional miRNAs whose overexpression has been found to be associated with different types of cancer including breast cancer. To further determine the potential involvement of miR-155 in breast cancer, we evaluated the expression levels of miR-155 by real-time PCR and correlated the results with clinicopathological features. Matched non-tumor and tumor tissues of 42 infiltrating ductal carcinomas and 3 infiltrating lobular carcinomas were analyzed for miR-155 expression by real-time PCR. Further, we used an antisense technique to inhibit miR-155 expression in vitro. WST-8 test was performed to evaluate cell viability and apoptosis assay was used to investigate the effect of the miR-155 antisense oligonucleotide (miR-155 ASO) on HS578T cell death. The expression levels of miR-155 were significantly higher in tumor tissues than the levels in matched non-tumor tissues (P&lt;0.001). Up-regulated miR-155 expression was associated with lymph node positivity (P=0.034), higher proliferation index (Ki-67 &gt;10%) (P=0.019) and advanced breast cancer TNM clinical stage (P=0.002). Interestingly, we next found that miR-155 expression levels had close relations with ER status (P=0.041) and PR status (P=0.029). Transfection efficiency detected by flow cytometry was higher than 70%, the WST-8 test showed that viability of HS578T cells was greatly reduced after transfection with miR-155 ASO compared with the scramble (SCR) group or the liposome group. The Annexin V-FITC/PI assay also indicated that transfection with miR-155 ASO promoted apoptosis.
