WSS25 inhibits Dicer, downregulating microRNA-210, which targets Ephrin-A3, to suppress human microvascular endothelial cell (HMEC-1) tube formation. WSS25 is a sulfated polysaccharide that inhibits angiogenesis. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of angiogenesis by WSS25 is not well understood. Using microRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis, a total of 25 miRNAs were found to be upregulated and 12 (including miR-210) downregulated by WSS25 in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Interestingly, Dicer, a key enzyme for miRNA biosynthesis, was downregulated by WSS25 in HMEC-1 cells. Further studies indicated that HMEC-1 cell tube formation and miR-210 expression were suppressed while Ephrin-A3 expression was enhanced by the silencing of Dicer. In contrast, HMEC-1 cell tube formation and miR-210 expression were induced while Ephrin-A3 expression was suppressed by Dicer overexpression. Moreover, miR-210 was downregulated while Ephrin-A3 was upregulated by WSS25 in HMEC-1 cells. HMEC-1 cell migration and tube formation were arrested, while Ephrin-A3 expression was augmented by anti-miR-210. In addition, HMEC-1 cell tube formation was significantly attenuated or augmented when Ephrin-A3 was overexpressed or silenced, respectively. Nevertheless, the tube formation blocked by WSS25 could be partially rescued by manipulation of Dicer, miR-210 and Ephrin-A3. These results suggest a new pathway whereby WSS25 inhibits angiogenesis via suppression of Dicer, leading to downregulation of miR-210 and upregulation of Ephrin-A3.
