microRNA-34a sensitizes lung cancer cell lines to DDP treatment independent of p53 status. miR-34a was identified as one of the downregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) in human lung cancer. However, the precise biological role of miR-34a in p53 deficient lung cancer cell lines remains largely elusive. In the present study, we aimed to identify the role of miR-34a in the regulation of lung cancer cell proliferation. Using quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we found that miR-34a was highly upregulated in the p53 wild-type A549 human lung cancer cell line when treated with the DNA damaging agent adriamycin (ADR), but not in the SBC-5 cells harboring mutated p53. Transient introduction of miR-34a into A549 and SBC-5 cell lines caused complete suppression of cell proliferation and induced the cell cycle arrested at the G(1) phase. When we knockdown the miR-34a downstream target--Sitr1--using the small-interfering RNA, there was also a cell growth inhibition in both cell lines though not as much as miR-34a did. Moreover, we demonstrated that pretransfection of miR-34a could increase the sensitivity of both lung cancer cell lines to cisplatin (DDP), and this could be reverted by the miR-34a inhibitor. Moreover, when cells pretreated with siR-Sirt1, they are more sensitive to DDP than the control pretreated cells as well. We thus hypothesize the miR-34a/Sirt1 cascade involved with p53-independent functions. Overall, in this study, we found the proliferation inhibition function of miR-34a in vitro in lung cancer cell lines is p53 independent, and also demonstrated the combination therapeutic potential of miR-34a and DDP in lung cancer cell lines.
