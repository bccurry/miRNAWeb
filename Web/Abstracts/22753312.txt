ZEB/miR-200 feedback loop: At the crossroads ofsignal transduction in cancer. Embryonic differentiation programs of epithelial-mesenchymaland mesenchymal-epithelial transition (EMT and MET) represent a mechanistic basis for epithelial cell plasticity implicated in cancer. Transcription factors of the ZEB protein family (ZEB1 and ZEB2) and several microRNA species (predominantly miR-200 family members) form a double negative feedback loop, which controls EMT and MET programs in both development and tumourigenesis. In this paper, we review crosstalk between theZEB/miR-200axis and several signal transduction pathwaysactivated at different stages of tumour development. The close association of ZEB proteins with these pathways is indirect evidence for the involvement of a ZEB/miR-200 loop in tumourinitiation, progression and spread. Additionally, the configuration of signalling pathways involving ZEB/miR-200 loop suggests that ZEB1 and ZEB2 may have different, possibly even opposing, roles in some forms of human cancer.
