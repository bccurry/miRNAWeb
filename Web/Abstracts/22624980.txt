miR-34a is downregulated in cis-diamminedichloroplatinum treated sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma patients with poor prognosis. For the purpose of analyzing mechanisms related to the cis-diamminedichloroplatinum resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, we analyzed RPMI2650 and its derived previously established cis-diamminedichloroplatinum resistant cell line RPMI2650CR. To identify resistant phenotype-related microRNAs, we compared microRNA expressions between RPMI2650CR and RPMI2650 by microarray. One of the microRNAs as downregulated, miR-34a, was further investigated. Decreased expression of miR-34a in RPMI2650CR was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, but introduction of the miR-34a precursor into RPMI2650CR or the inhibitor of miR-34a into RPMI2650 did not change cis-diamminedichloroplatinum sensitivities. However, 24 patients with sinonasal squamous cell carcinomas treated with intra-arterial infusion of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum showed a significant association between decreased expression of miR-34a and poor disease specific survival (P = 0.0015), poor disease free survival (P = 0.0019), and poor local control rates (P = 0.017) (median follow-up period: 53 months). Furthermore, multivariate analyses demonstrated significant associations between miR-34a expression and the hazard ratios of disease free survival at 0.005 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.00-0.29, P = 0.011) and local control rate at 0.008 (95% CI 0.00-0.44, P = 0.019), although other parameters such as age, gender, treatment method, T and N stages did not show any similar association. These results strongly suggest that miR-34a expression can be an independent prognostic biomarker in patients with sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma who are undergoing treatment with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum.
