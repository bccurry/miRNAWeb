A miR-21 hairpin structure-based gene knockdown vector. RNA interference (RNAi) is widely used to study gene functions as a reverse genetic means from first-generation siRNA to second-generation short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or the newly developed microRNA (shRNA-miR). Here we report a gene knockdown vector system based on the mouse miR-21 hairpin structure. In this system, the pre-miRNA hairpin of the miR-21 gene was modified by replacing the 22-nucleotide mature sequence with shRNA sequences that target genes of interest, flanked by 160-bp upstream and 65-bp downstream sequences of the mouse pre-miR-21. We tested this system by knocking down the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) reporter gene using different vectors, in which shRNA-miR was driven by the polymerase II (pol II) promoter. We found that miR-21 hairpin-based shRNA-miR can be directly placed under pol II promoter, like UbC or CMV promoter to knockdown the gene of interest. To facilitate the wide application of the miR-21 hairpin-based gene knockdown system, we further knocked down the endogenous gene lamin (A/C), which showed that endogenous lamin A/C expression can be efficiently silenced using the miR-21 hairpin-based lentiviral vector. The miR-21 hairpin-based gene knockdown vector will provide a new genetic tool for gene functional studies in vitro and in vivo.
