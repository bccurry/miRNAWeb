Identification of miR-130a, miR-27b and miR-210 as serum biomarkers for atherosclerosis obliterans. Arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) is a kind of peripheral arterial disease. Most patients with ASO have no apparent clinical symptoms early on, but a diagnosis at the early stage is essential to prevent progression. Unfortunately, the specific and sensitive markers for ASO are still lacking currently. In this study, using both tissue samples and blood samples obtained from ASO patients, we aim to find a cluster of miRNAs that can be used as new risk-markers for the diagnosis of ASO in the earlier stages. We enrolled 104 patients diagnosed with ASO and 105 age-matched controls. We examined the expression levels of a series of miRNAs in both intima samples and serum samples from these patients. Levels of miR-21, miR-130a, miR-27b, let-7f and miR-210 significantly increased, while levels of miR-221 and miR-222 significantly decreased in the sclerotic samples compared with normal samples. Significant increase of miR-130a, miR-27b and miR-210 expression was observed in the serum samples of ASO patients. Moreover, the expression of miR-130a and miR-27b in sera of ASO patients was positively correlated with Fontaine stages. The serum levels of miR-130a, miR-27b and miR-210 may serve as potential biomarkers for early stage ASO.
