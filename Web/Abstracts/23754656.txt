MicroRNA1 inhibits the proliferation of chinese sika deerderived cartilage cells by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of IGF1. Insulinlike growth factor1 (IGF1) is critical in the proliferation and regeneration of Chinese sika deer antler cells. The regulation of IGF1 is complex and remains unclear. In the present study, miRNA GeneChip and TargetScan Human software were used to identify microRNA1 (miR1), which binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of IGF1. An miR1 mimic was transfected into antler cartilage cells in order to induce the overexpression of miR1. The expression levels of miR1 in antler cartilage cells were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A highthroughput luciferase reporter screen was used to demonstrate the potential regulation of IGF1 by miR1. miR1 suppressed the luciferase activity of the pmiRIGF1 by ~50% compared with the negative control (NC). An MTT assay and cell cycle analyses confirmed that the overexpression of miR1 significantly inhibited the proliferation of cartilage cells (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed that overexpressed miR1 downregulated the protein levels of IGF1. The 3'UTR of IGF1 was found to have an miR1 combining site, which allowed the inhibition of IGF1 protein expression, as demonstrated by a luciferase reporter assay, and miR1 was shown to be an important and effective means of regulating IGF-1. In conclusion, miR1 downregulated the protein expression of IGF1 by directly targeting the 3'UTR of IGF1. miR1 may be crucial for inhibiting the proliferation of deer antler cartilage cells. Our findings provided the evidence for the first time that miR1 directly regulates the expression of IGF1 by directly targeting its 3'UTR.
