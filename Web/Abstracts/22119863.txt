Gene silencing efficiency and INF- induction effects of splicing miRNA 155-based artificial miRNA with pre-miRNA stem-loop structures. Artificial microRNA (miRNA) expression vectors have been developed and used for RNA interference. The secondary structure of artificial miRNA is important for RNA interference efficacy. We designed two groups of six artificial splicing miRNA 155-based miRNAs (SM155-based miRNAs) with the same target in the coding region or 3' UTR of a target gene and studied their RNA silencing efficiency and interferon  (IFN-) induction effects. SM155-based miRNA with a mismatch at the +1 position and a bulge at the +11, +12 positions in a miRNA precursor stem-loop structure showed the highest gene silencing efficiency and lowest IFN- induction effect (increased IFN- mRNA level by 10% in both target cases), regardless of the specificity of the target sequence, suggesting that pSM155-based miRNA with this design could be a valuable miRNA expression vector.
