miR-21 and miR-31 converge on TIAM1 to regulate migration and invasion of colon carcinoma cells. TGF- promotes cell migration and invasion, an attribute that is linked to the pro-metastasis function of this cytokine in late stage cancers. The LIM 1863 colon carcinoma organoid undergoes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to TGF-. This process is markedly accelerated by TNF-, and we found that the levels of miR-21 and miR-31 were prominently elevated under the synergistic actions of TGF-/TNF-. Consistent with this, overexpression of either miR-21 or miR-31 significantly enhanced the effect of TGF- alone on LIM 1863 morphological changes. More importantly, transwell assays demonstrated the positive effects of both miR-21 and miR-31 in TGF- regulation of LIM 1863 motility and invasiveness. Elevated levels of miR-21 and miR-31 also enhanced motility and invasiveness of other colon carcinoma cell lines. We present compelling evidence that TIAM1, a guanidine exchange factor of the Rac GTPase, is a direct target of both miR-21 and miR-31. Indeed in LIM 1863 cells, suppression of TIAM1 is required for miR-21/miR-31 to enhance cell migration and invasion. Therefore, we have uncovered miR-21 and miR-31 as downstream effectors of TGF- in facilitating invasion and metastasis of colon carcinoma cells.
