Association between microRNA196a2 rs11614913 genotypes and the risk of non-small cell lung cancer in Korean population. The microRNA (miRNA) miR-196a2 may play an important role in lung cancer development and survival by altering binding activity of target mRNA. In this study, we evaluated their associations with the susceptibility of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) by case-control study in a Korean population. We performed genotyping analyses for miR-196a2 rs11614913 T/C at miRNA regions in a case-control study using blood samples of 406 NSCLC patient and 428 cancer-free control groups. The total C allele frequencies for miR-196a2 were 48.8% for the patients and 45.6% for the controls; and the genotype frequencies of TT, TC, and CC were 23.7%, 55.2%, and 21.1% for the patients and 31.1%, 46.35%, and 22.4% for the controls (p&lt;0.05). Participants who possesses TC/CC genotypes showed high risk for NSCLC compared to those possessed TT genotypes (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.96). The association was persisted in 60 and older age group, male, smokers, those without family history for cancer. However, no significant association of CC genotypes in recessive genetic model was observed. In conclusion, this case-control study provides evidence that miR-196a2 rs11614913 C/T polymorphisms are associated with a significantly increased risk of NSCLC in a dominant model, indicating that common genetic polymorphisms in miR-196a2 rs11614913 are associated with NSCLC. The association of miR196a2 rs11614913 polymorphisms and NSCLC risk require confirmation through additional larger studies.
