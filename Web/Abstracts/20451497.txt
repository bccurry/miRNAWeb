Altered microRNAs in STHdh(Q111)/Hdh(Q111) cells: miR-146a targets TBP. We studied expression of 90 miRNAs in STHdh(Q111)/Hdh(Q111) cells, a model for Huntington's disease and compared with that obtained in STHdh(Q7)/Hdh(Q7) cells. Fifteen miRNAs were down regulated and 12 miRNAs were up regulated more than 2-fold. Such changes were statistically significant. One hundred and forty-two genes are experimentally known targets of these altered miRNAs. It has been predicted that miR-146a may target Tata Binding Protein (TBP). Using luciferase reporter assays with 3'-UTRs of TBP, over-expression and inhibition of miR-146a, we showed that miR-146a targets TBP. Regulation of TBP by miR-146a may contribute to HD pathogenesis.
