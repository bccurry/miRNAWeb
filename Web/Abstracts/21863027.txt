miR-21 and miR-155 are associated with mitotic activity and lesion depth of borderline melanocytic lesions. Expression of microRNAs (miRs) has been shown to be altered in many solid tumours and is being explored in melanoma. The malignant potential of some melanocytic lesions is difficult to predict. We hypothesised that characterisation of miR expression in borderline melanocytic proliferations would lead to the identification of a molecular profile that could be used with known prognostic factors to differentiate lesions with high malignant potential. The miR expression profile of melanocytic lesions (benign naevi, malignant melanoma and borderline melanocytic tumours) was evaluated by real-time PCR. PCR analysis revealed primary cutaneous melanomas had an 8.6-fold overexpression of miR-21 and a 7.5-fold overexpression of miR-155 compared with benign naevi (P&lt;0.0001). In situ hybridisation confirmed these results. miR-21 and miR-155 were significantly overexpressed within borderline lesions (P=0.0011 and P=0.0048, respectively). When borderline lesions were categorised by mitotic activity and Breslow thickness, miR-21 was associated with mitotic activity and miR-155 was associated with thickness (P&lt;0.025). Among 14 patients with borderline lesions who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), positive SLNB was associated with increased miR-21 and miR-155 in the primary lesion compared with lesions with a negative SLNB. MicroRNA expression profiles can be used to characterise atypical melanocytic lesions.
