Expression of miRNA-130a in nonsmall cell lung cancer. MicroRNAs are short regulatory RNAs that negatively modulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of several types of cancer. The miRNA-130a has been shown to play a role in antagonizing the inhibitory effects of GAX on endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation, and antagonizing the inhibitory effects of HoxA5 on tube formation in vitro. Here the authors show, for the first time, that miRNA-130a expression is increased in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues. Statistical analysis showed that overexpression of miRNA-130a was strongly associated with lymph node metastasis, stage of tumor node metastasis classification and poor prognosis. Moreover, there was a significant difference in miRNA-130a expression levels between smoking and nonsmoking patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that miRNA-130a was an independent prognostic factor for patients with NSCLC. Together, these data suggest that miRNA-130a may comprise a potential novel prognostic marker for this disease.
