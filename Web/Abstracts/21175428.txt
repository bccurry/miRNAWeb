Involvement of miR-30c and miR-301a in immediate induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 by placental growth factor in human pulmonary endothelial cells. PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) is a key physiological inhibitor of fibrinolysis. Previously, we have reported PlGF (placental growth factor)-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of PAI-1 (SERPINE1) mRNA expression via activation of HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1) and AP-1 (activator protein-1) in HPMVECs (human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells), which resulted in elevated PAI-1 in humans with SCA (sickle cell anaemia). In the present study, we have identified the role of post-transcriptional mechanism(s) of PlGF-mediated accumulation of PAI-1 mRNA in HPMVECs by examining the role of microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) in PlGF-induced PAI-1 mRNA stability. Our results show reduced expression of miR-30c and miR-301a, but not of miR-99a, in response to PlGF, which have evolutionarily conserved binding sites in the 3'-UTR (3'-untranslated region) of PAI-1 mRNA. Transfection of anti-miR-30c or anti-miR-301a oligonucleotides resulted in increased PAI-1 mRNA levels, which were increased further with PlGF stimulation. Conversely, overexpression of pre-miR-30c or pre-miR-301a resulted in an attenuation of PlGF-induced PAI-1 mRNA and protein levels. Luciferase reporter assays using wild-type and mutant 3'-UTR constructs confirmed that the PAI-1 3'-UTR is indeed a direct target of miR-30c and miR-301a. Finally, plasma levels of miR-30c and miR-301a were significantly down-regulated in patients with SCA compared with normal controls. These results provide a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of PlGF-induced PAI-1 elevation.
