MicroRNA 125a and its regulation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. MicroRNA (miRNA) are a class of non-coding RNA that suppress gene expression by degradation or translational inhibition of target RNA. Several miRNA have been shown to target oncogenes and recently miRNA-125b was shown to translationally and transcriptionally inhibit the p53 gene. Here, we show that an additional isomer of miRNA-125 (miRNA-125a) translationally arrests mRNA of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. The basis of this activity is the high degree of sequence homology between the seed sequence of miR-125a and the 3'-UTR of p53. Our findings add miRNA-125a to the growing list of miRNA with oncogenic targets.
