Differential expression of miRNAs in the nervous system of a rat model of bilateral sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury. Chronic neuropathic pain is associated with global changes in gene expression in different areas of the nociceptive pathway. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt long) non-coding RNAs, which are able to regulate hundreds of different genes post-transcriptionally. The aim of this study was to determine the miRNA expression patterns in the different regions of the pain transmission pathway using a rat model of human neuropathic pain induced by bilateral sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (bCCI). Using microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, we observed a significant upregulation in miR-341 expression in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), but not in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH), hippocampus or anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), in the rats with neuropathic pain compared to rats in the nave and sham-operated groups. By contrast, the expression of miR-203, miR-181a-1* and miR-541* was significantly reduced in the SDH of rats with neuropathic pain. Our data indicate that miR-341 is upregulated in the DRG, whereas miR-203, miR-181a-1* and miR-541* are downregulated in the SDH under neuropathic pain conditions. Thus, the differential expression of miRNAs in the nervous system may play a role in the development of chronic pain. These observations may aid in the development of novel treatment methods for neuropathic pain, which may involve miRNA gene therapy in local regions.
