Resveratrol decreases the levels of miR-155 by upregulating miR-663, a microRNA targeting JunB and JunD. An inflammatory component is present in the microenvironment of most neoplastic tissues, including those not causally related to an obvious inflammatory process. Several microRNAs, and especially miR-155, play an essential role in both the innate and adaptative immune response. Resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties that is currently at the stage of preclinical studies for human cancer prevention. Here, we establish that, in human THP-1 monocytic cells as well as in human blood monocytes, resveratrol upregulates miR-663, a microRNA potentially targeting multiple genes implicated in the immune response. In THP-1 cells, miR-663 decreases endogenous activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity and impairs its upregulation by lipopolysaccharides (LPS), at least in part by directly targeting JunB and JunD transcripts. We further establish that the downregulation of AP-1 activity by resveratrol is miR-663 dependent and that the effects of resveratrol on both AP-1 activity and JunB levels are dose dependent. Finally, we show that resveratrol impairs the upregulation of miR-155 by LPS in a miR-663-dependent manner. Given the role of miR-155 in the innate immune response and the fact that it is upregulated in many cancers, our results suggest that manipulating miR-663 levels may help to optimize the use of resveratrol as both an anti-inflammatory and anticancer agent against malignancies associated with high levels of miR-155.
