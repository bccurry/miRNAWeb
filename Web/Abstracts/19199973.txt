MicroRNA involvement in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma: potential for microRNA mediated therapeutics. Neuroblastoma arises from precursor cells of the sympathetic nervous system and presently accounts for 15% of all childhood cancer deaths. These tumors display remarkable heterogeneity in clinical behavior, ranging from spontaneous regression to rapid progression and resistance to therapy. The clinical behavior of these tumors is associated with many factors, including patient age, histopathology and genetic abnormalities such as MYCN amplification. More recently, the dysregulation of some miRNAs, including the miR-17-5p-92 cluster and miR-34a, has been implicated in the pathobiology of neuroblastoma. MiR-17-5p-92 family members act in an oncogenic manner while miR-34a has tumor suppressor functions. The evidence for the contribution of miRNAs in the aggressive neuroblastoma phenotype is reviewed in this article, along with exciting possibilities for miRNA mediated therapeutics.
