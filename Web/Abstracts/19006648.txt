miR-34a inhibits migration and invasion by down-regulation of c-Met expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Several studies have shown that miR-34a represses the expression of many genes and induces G1 arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. In the present study, we identified the role of miR-34a in the regulation of tumor cell scattering, migration, and invasion. Down-regulation of miR-34a expression was highly significant in 19 of 25 (76%) human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues and associated with the metastasis and invasion of tumors. Furthermore, resected normal/tumor tissues of 25 HCC patients demonstrated an inverse correlation between miR-34a and c-Met-protein. In HepG2 cells, ectopic expression of miR-34a potently inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion in a c-Met-dependent manner. miR-34a directly targeted c-Met and reduced both mRNA and protein levels of c-Met; thus, decreased c-Met-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Taken together, these results provide evidence to show the suppression role of miR-34a in tumor migration and invasion through modulation of the c-Met signaling pathway.
