Epigenetically deregulated microRNA-375 is involved in a positive feedback loop with estrogen receptor alpha in breast cancer cells. Estrogen receptor  (ER) upregulation causes abnormal cell proliferation in about two thirds of breast cancers, yet understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains incomplete. Here, we show that high expression of the microRNA miR-375 in ER-positive breast cell lines is a key driver of their proliferation. miR-375 overexpression was caused by loss of epigenetic marks including H3K9me2 and local DNA hypomethylation, dissociation of the transcriptional repressor CTCF from the miR-375 promoter, and interactions of ER with regulatory regions of miR-375. Inhibiting miR-375 in ER-positive MCF-7 cells resulted in reduced ER activation and cell proliferation. A combination of expression profiling from tumor samples and miRNA target prediction identified RASD1 as a potential miR-375 target. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-375 regulates RASD1 by targeting the 3' untranslated region in RASD1 mRNA. Additionally, we found that RASD1 negatively regulates ER expression. Our findings define a forward feedback pathway in control of ER expression, highlighting new strategies to treat ER-positive invasive breast tumors.
