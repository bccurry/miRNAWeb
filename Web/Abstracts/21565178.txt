Association between SNPs in pre-miRNA and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by irreversible airway obstruction and persistent chronic airway inflammation and is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. This study aimed to explore the genetic aspect of its initial occurrence. We conducted a case-control study of 432 COPD patients and 511 control subjects frequency-matched in age and gender distribution. We genotyped three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pre-miRNAs using a PCR-RFLP assay and evaluated their relevance to COPD susceptibility. We found that the TT genotype and T allele of miR-196a2 rs11614913 were significantly associated with a decreased risk for COPD, compared with the CC genotype and C allele. Similarly, the GG genotype and G allele of miR-499 rs3746444 were associated with a decreased risk for COPD, compared with the AA genotype and A allele. These findings suggest that both rs11614913 and rs3746444 may be involved in susceptibility to COPD.
