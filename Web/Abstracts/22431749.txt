MicroRNA-30c-2* limits expression of proadaptive factor XBP1 in the unfolded protein response. Stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), a multifaceted signaling system coordinating translational control and gene transcription to promote cellular adaptation and survival. Microribonucleic acids (RNAs; miRNAs), single-stranded RNAs that typically function as posttranscriptional modulators of gene activity, have been shown to inhibit translation of certain secretory pathway proteins during the UPR. However, it remains unclear whether miRNAs regulate UPR signaling effectors directly. In this paper, we report that a star strand miRNA, miR-30c-2* (recently designated miR-30c-2-3p), is induced by the protein kinase RNA activated-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway of the UPR and governs expression of XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1), a key transcription factor that augments secretory capacity and promotes cell survival in the adaptive UPR. These data provide the first link between an miRNA and direct regulation of the ER stress response and reveal a novel molecular mechanism by which the PERK pathway, via miR-30c-2*, influences the scale of XBP1-mediated gene expression and cell fate in the UPR.
