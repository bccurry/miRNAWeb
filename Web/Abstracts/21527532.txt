Overexpression of microRNA-16-2 contributes to the abnormal erythropoiesis in polycythemia vera. Deregulated expression of microRNAs is associated with neoplasia. Here, we show that mature miR-16 levels are abnormally increased in CD34(+) cells of patients with polycythemia vera as a consequence of preferential expression of miR-16-2 on chromosome 3 rather than of miR-16-1 on chromosome 13. Forced expression of miRNA-16 in normal CD34(+) cells stimulated erythroid cell proliferation and maturation. Conversely, exposure of polycythemia vera CD34(+) cells to small interfering RNA against pre-miR-16-2 reduced erythroid colonies and largely prevented formation of erythropoietin-independent colonies; myeloid progenitors remained unaffected. Experiments with knock down of JAK2 indicated that overexpression of miR-16 was independent of JAK/STAT pathway activation. Mice injected with an miR-16 antagomir showed a blunted erythroid response to exogenous erythropoietin, which indicates a role of miR-16 in normal erythropoiesis. These data suggest that deregulation of miR-16-2 contributes to abnormal expansion of erythroid lineage in polycythemia vera. However, the mechanisms for miR-16-2 overexpression remain to be elucidated, because no genetic abnormalities at the miR-16-2 locus were discovered.
