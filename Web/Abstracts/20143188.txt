miRNA-21 regulates arsenic-induced anti-leukemia activity in myelogenous cell lines. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNA molecules involved in modulation of cellular sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. miRNA-21 (miR-21), one of the most prominent miRNAs in the genesis and progression of many human cancers, has been rarely characterized in myelogenous leukemia. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) was successfully used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) etc. However, cytotoxicity or insensitivity is a major concern in the successful treatment of leukemia. Here, we used a specific precursor miRNA-21 (pre-miR-21) or anti-miRNA-21 oligonucleotide (AMO-miR-21) to study sensitivity of HL60 and K562 cells to ATO. Cell viability and cell cycle were evaluated by MTT assay and PI assay using flow cytometry, respectively. Levels of miR-21 and its target PDCD4 were quantified by real-time PCR and/or western blot. AMO-miR-21 or ATO alone led to growth inhibition, apoptosis and G1 phase arrest of cell cycle. Apoptotic cells were confirmed morphologically with Hoechst staining. Moreover, there was somewhat synergistic effect of AMO-miR-21 and ATO in growth inhibition and apoptosis promotion. Meanwhile, enforced pre-miR-21 expression increased resistance to ATO, nevertheless not affecting cell growth alone. Dual-luciferase reporter vector containing two tandem PDCD4 3' UTR validated that PDCD4 was directly up-regulated by miR-21. Therefore, miRNA-21 by targeting PDCD4 may play a functional role in modulating ATO-induced cell death, and strategy using AMO-miR-21 and its combination with ATO may be useful as a myelogenous leukemia therapy.
