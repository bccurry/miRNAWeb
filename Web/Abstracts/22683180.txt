Aberrant expression of microRNAs in gastric cancer and biological significance of miR-574-3p. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) provides a new and powerful tool for studying the mechanisms, diagnosis and treatments of cancer. In this study, we employed AFFX miRNA expression chips to search for miRNAs that may be aberrantly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and to investigate the potential roles that miRNAs may play in the development and progression of gastric cancer. 14 miRNAs were found to be down-regulated and 2 miRNAs up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues compared to the normal gastric tissues. Among the aberrantly expressed miRNAs, miR-574-3p was selected to further study its expression features and functional roles. Interestingly, the reduced expression of miR-574-3p occurred mainly in the early stages of gastric cancer or in cancers with high level of differentiation, suggesting that it can be used as a marker for a mild case of gastric cancer. Functional study revealed that cell proliferation, migration and invasion were significantly inhibited in miR-574-3p-transfected gastric cancer SGC7901 cells. Computational prediction and experimental validation suggest that Cullin2 may be one of the targets of miR-574-3p. Overall our study suggests that the aberrantly expressed miRNAs may play regulatory and functional roles in the development and progression of gastric cancer.
