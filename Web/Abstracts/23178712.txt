miR-137 inhibits the proliferation of lung cancer cells by targeting Cdc42 and Cdk6. MicroRNAs (miRNA) have emerged as key players in carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of miR-137 in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. The downregulation of miR-137 in lung cancer cells could be rescued following inhibition of DNA methylation. Ectopic expression of miR-137 in lung cancer cells significantly downregulated Cdc42, Cdk6 and induced G1 cell cycle arrest, leading to a significant decrease in cell growth in vivo and in vitro. Further, both Cdc42 and Cdk6 were confirmed as targets of miR-137.
