Upregulation of miR-142-3p in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of operationally tolerant patients with a renal transplant. Achieving drug-free tolerance or successfully using only small doses of immunosuppression is a major goal in organ transplantation. To investigate the potential mechanisms by which some kidney transplant recipients can achieve operational tolerance, we compared the expression profiles of microRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of operationally tolerant patients with those of stable patients treated with conventional immunosuppression. B cells from operationally tolerant patients overexpressed miR-142-3p. The expression of miR-142-3p was stable over time and was not modulated by immunosuppression. In Raji B cells, overexpression of miR-142-3p modulated nearly 1000 genes related to the immune response of B cells, including potential miR-142-3p targets and molecules previously identified in the blood of operationally tolerant patients. Furthermore, our results suggested that a negative feedback loop involving TGF- signaling and miR-142-3p expression in B cells may contribute to the maintenance of tolerance. In summary, miR-142-3p expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells correlates with operational tolerance. Whether upregulation of miR-142-3p modulates inflammatory responses to promote tolerance or is a result of this tolerance state requires further study.
