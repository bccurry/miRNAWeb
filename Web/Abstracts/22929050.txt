Manipulation of autophagy by MIR375 generates antitumor effects in liver cancer. The exploration into the roles of autophagy in tumorigenesis, either as tumor suppressor or tumor promoter, has led to a great increase in the knowledge of cancer development, progression and treatment. However, there is currently no consensus on how to manipulate autophagy to improve antitumor effects. In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy in established liver cancer cells in response to hypoxia. Hypoxia not only is the most pervasive microenvironmental stress in solid tumors but is also a canonical stimulus for autophagy. The involvement of dysregulated microRNAs in hypoxia-induced autophagy and their therapeutic potential in advanced liver cancer were examined.
