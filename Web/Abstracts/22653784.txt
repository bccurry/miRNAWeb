MicroRNAs are universal regulators of differentiation, activation, and polarization of microglia and macrophages in normal and diseased CNS. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small (22 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs involved in the regulation of gene expression at the post-translational level. It is estimated that 30-90% of human genes are regulated by miRNAs, which makes these molecules of great importance for cell growth, activation, and differentiation. Microglia is CNS-resident cells of a myeloid lineage that play an important role in immune surveillance and are actively involved in many neurologic pathologies. Although the exact origin of microglia remains enigmatic, it is established that primitive macrophages from a yolk sac populate the brain and spinal cord in normal conditions throughout development. During various pathological events such as neuroinflammation, bone marrow derived myeloid cells also migrate into the CNS. Within the CNS, both primitive macrophages from the yolk sac and bone marrow derived myeloid cells acquire a specific phenotype upon interaction with other cell types within the CNS microenvironment. The factors that drive differentiation of progenitors into microglia and control the state of activation of microglia and bone marrow-derived myeloid cells within the CNS are not well understood. In this review we will summarize the role of miRNAs during activation and differentiation of myeloid cells. The role of miR-124 in the adaptation of microglia and macrophages to the CNS microenvironment will be further discussed. We will also summarize the role of miRNAs as modulators of activation of microglia and microphages. Finally, we will describe the role of miR-155 and miR-124 in the polarization of macrophages towards classically and alternatively activated phenotypes.  2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
