MicroRNA-107 inhibits glioma cell migration and invasion by modulating Notch2 expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-protein-coding RNA molecules, modulate target gene expression by binding to 3'untranslated regions (UTR) of target mRNA. These molecules are aberrantly expressed in many human cancers, and can function either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. In the current study, we show that miR-107 is down-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines, and its overexpression leads to inhibition of the migratory and invasive ability of glioma cells via direct targeting of Notch2, which is known to transactivate Tenascin-C and Cox-2. Experiments with Notch2 siRNA further suggest that miR-107 may exerts its anti-invasive activity through Notch2 signaling pathways. Our findings collectively indicate that miR-107 is involved in glioma cell migration and invasion, and support its utility as a potential target for glioma treatment.
