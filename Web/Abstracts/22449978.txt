miR-20a promotes migration and invasion by regulating TNKS2 in human cervical cancer cells. miR-20a is an important member of the miR-17-92 cluster, and its real function in cervical cancer cells is unknown. Our study demonstrated that miR-20a was upregulated in cervical cancer tissues. Overexpression of miR-20a in cervical cancer-derived cell lines, HeLa and C-33A, enhanced long-term cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas inhibition of miR-20a suppressed those functions. We also confirmed that oncogenic TNKS2 is directly upregulated by miR-20a. Furthermore, suppression of TNKS2 expression could inhibit colony formation, migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Therefore, we concluded that miR-20a can promote migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells through the upregulation of TNKS2.
