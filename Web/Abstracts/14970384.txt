miRNP:mRNA association in polyribosomes in a human neuronal cell line. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that control gene expression by base-pairing with their mRNA targets. miRNAs assemble into ribonucleoprotein complexes termed miRNPs. Animal miRNAs recognize their mRNA targets via partial antisense complementarity and repress mRNA translation at a step after translation initiation. How animal miRNAs recognize their mRNA targets and how they control their translation is unknown. Here we describe that in a human neuronal cell line, the miRNP proteins eIF2C2 (a member of the Argonaute family of proteins), Gemin3, and Gemin4 along with miRNAs cosediment with polyribosomes. Furthermore, we describe a physical association between a let-7b (miRNA)-containing miRNP and its putative human mRNA target in polyribosome-containing fractions. These findings suggest that miRNP proteins may play important roles in target mRNA recognition and translational repression.
