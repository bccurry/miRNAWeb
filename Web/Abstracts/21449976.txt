Angiotensin II type 1 receptor signalling regulates microRNA differentially in cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes. The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) is a key regulator of blood pressure and cardiac contractility and is profoundly involved in development of cardiac disease. Since several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in cardiac disease, we determined whether miRNAs might be regulated by AT(1)R signals in a Gq/11-dependent or -independent manner. We performed a global miRNA array analysis of angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated miRNA regulation in HEK293N cells overexpressing the AT(1)R and focused on separating the role of Gq/11-dependent and -independent pathways. MiRNA regulation was verified with quantitative PCR in both HEK293N cells and primary cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. Our studies revealed five miRNAs (miR-29b, -129-3p, -132, -132* and -212) that were up-regulated by Ang II in HEK293N cells. In contrast, the biased Ang II analogue, [Sar1, Ile4, Ile8] Ang II (SII Ang II), which selectively activates Gq/11-independent signalling, failed to regulate miRNAs in HEK293N cells. Furthermore, Ang II-induced miRNA regulation was blocked following Gq/11 and Mek1 inhibition. The observed Ang II regulation of miRNA was confirmed in primary cultures of adult cardiac fibroblasts. Interestingly, Ang II did not regulate miRNA expression in cardiac myocytes, but SII Ang II significantly down-regulated miR-129-3p. Five miRNAs were regulated by Ang II through mechanisms depending on Gq/11 and Erk1/2 activation. These miRNAs may be involved in Ang II-mediated cardiac biology and disease, as several of these miRNAs have previously been associated with cardiovascular disease and were found to be regulated in cardiac cells.
