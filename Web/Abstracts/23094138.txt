Differential expression of HIV-1 interfering factors in monocyte-derived macrophages stimulated with polarizing cytokines or interferons. HIV-1 replication in macrophages can be regulated by cytokines and infection is restricted in macrophages activated by type I interferons and polarizing cytokines. Here, we observed that the expression levels of the cellular factors Trim5, CypA, APOBEC3G, SAMHD-1, Trim22, tetherin and TREX-1, and the anti-HIV miRNAs miR-28, miR-150, miR-223 and miR-382 was upregulated by IFN- and IFN- in macrophages, which may account for the inhibiting effect on viral replication and the antiviral state of these cells. Expression of these factors was also increased by IFN- +/- TNF-, albeit to a lesser extent; yet, HIV-1 replication in these cells was not restricted at the level of proviral synthesis, indicating that these cellular factors only partially contribute to the observed restriction. IL-4, IL-10 or IL-32 polarization did not affect the expression of cellular factors and miRNAs, suggesting only a limited role for these cellular factors in restricting HIV-1 replication in macrophages.
