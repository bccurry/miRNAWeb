Down-regulated miR-625 suppresses invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by targeting ILK. Accumulating evidence has shown that microRNAs are involved in multiple processes in cancer development and progression. Here, we report that expression of miR-625 is significantly down-regulated and negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer. miR-625 significantly inhibits invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we identify that ILK is a direct target gene for miR-625 and knockdown of ILK has a phenocopy of overexpression of miR-625. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-625 plays an important role in the mechanism of tumor metastasis.
