Local Inhibition of MicroRNA-24 Improves Reparative Angiogenesis and Left Ventricle Remodeling and Function in Mice With Myocardial Infarction. Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of death worldwide. MicroRNAs regulate the expression of their target genes, thus mediating a plethora of pathophysiological functions. Recently, miRNA-24 emerged as an important but controversial miRNA involved in post-MI responses. Here, we aimed at clarifying the effect of adenovirus-mediate intra-myocardial delivery of a decoy for miRNA-24 in a mouse MI model and to investigate the impact of miRNA-24 inhibition on angiogenesis and cardiovascular apoptosis. After MI induction, miRNA-24 expression was lower in the peri-infarct tissue and its resident cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts; while it increased in endothelial cells (ECs). Local adenovirus-mediated miRNA-24 decoy delivery increased angiogenesis and blood perfusion in the peri-infarct myocardium, reduced infarct size, induced fibroblast apopotosis and overall improved cardiac function. Notwithstanding these beneficial effects, miRNA-24 decoy increased cardiomyocytes apoptosis. In vitro, miRNA-24 inhibition enhanced ECs survival, proliferation and networking in capillary-like tubes and induced cardiomyocyte and fibroblast apoptosis. Finally, we identified eNOS as a novel direct target of miR-24 in human cultured ECs and in vivo. Our findings suggest that miRNA-24 inhibition exerts distinct biological effects on ECs, cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. The overall result of post-infarction local miRNA-24 inhibition appears to be therapeutic.
