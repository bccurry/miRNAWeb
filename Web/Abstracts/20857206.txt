Oct4 regulates the miR-302 cluster in P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells. Oct4 is a transcription factor that is required for pluripotency during early embryogenesis and the maintenance of embryonic stem (ES) cell and pluripotent cell identity. miR-302, a cluster of eight microRNAs (miRNAs) that are expressed specifically in ES cells and pluripotent cells, is crucial for normal pluripotent cell self-renewal and pluripotency. But, the mechanism by which miR-302 participates in the core regulatory circuitry that controls self-renewal and pluripotency in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells has not been established. Here, we show that Oct4 is required for the expression and transcriptional activation of miR-302 and that Oct4 binds to the putative promoter of miR-302, suggesting that Oct4 activates the primary miR-302 transcript in P19 cells. This study proposes that the miR-302 cluster acts downstream of the Oct4 regulation network in P19 cells.
