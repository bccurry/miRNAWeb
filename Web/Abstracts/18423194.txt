miRiad roles for the miR-17-92 cluster in development and disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) encoded by the miR-17-92 cluster and its paralogs are known to act as oncogenes. Expression of these miRNAs promotes cell proliferation, suppresses apoptosis of cancer cells, and induces tumor angiogenesis. New work reveals essential functions for these miRNAs not only in tumor formation but also during normal development of the heart, lungs, and immune system.
