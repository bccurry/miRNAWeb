miR-23a, a critical regulator of &quot;migR&quot;ation and metastasis in colorectal cancer. Jahid and colleagues have shown that miR-23a promotes the transition from indolent to invasive colorectal cancer through inhibition of the MTSS1 tumor suppressor. This study reveals a novel role of miR-23a in the acceleration of colorectal cancer progression.
