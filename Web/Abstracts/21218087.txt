MiRNA profile in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: downregulation of miR-143 and miR-145. To investigate the expression profile of miRNA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The expression profile of miRNA in ESCC tissues was analyzed by miRNA microarray. The expression levels of miR-143 and miR-145 in 86 ESCC patients were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TaqMan assay. The mobility effect was estimated by wound-healing using esophageal carcinoma cells transfected with miRNA expression plasmids. A set of miRNAs was found to be deregulated in the ESCC tissues, and the expression levels of miR-143 and -145 were significantly decreased in most of the ESCC tissues examined. Both miR-143 and miR-145 expression correlated with tumor invasion depth. The transfection of human esophageal carcinoma cells with miR-143 and miR-145 expression plasmids resulted in a greater inhibition of cell mobility, however, the protein level of the previously reported target of miR-145, FSCN1, did not show any significant downregulation. These findings suggest that the deregulation of miRNAs plays an important role in the progression of ESCC. Both miR-143 and miR-145 might act as anti-oncomirs common to ESCC.
