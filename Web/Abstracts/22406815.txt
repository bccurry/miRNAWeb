MiR-217 is involved in Tat-induced HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation by down-regulation of SIRT1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and may contribute to the development and progression of many infective diseases including human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection. The Tat protein is fundamental to viral gene expression. In this study, our goal was to investigate the regulation of a specific miRNA (known as miR-217) in multinuclear activation of galactosidase indicator (MAGI) cells and explore the mechanisms by which miR-217 influenced Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation through down-regulation of SIRT1 expression. We showed that miR-217 was up-regulated when Tat was expressed in multinuclear activation of galactosidase indicator cells. Forced expression of &quot;miR-217 mimics&quot; increased Tat-induced LTR transactivation. In addition, miR-217 significantly inhibited SIRT1 protein expression by acting on the 3'-UTR of the SIRT1 mRNA. In turn, the decrease in SIRT1 protein abundance provoked by miR-217 affected two important types of downstream signaling molecules that were regulated by Tat. Lower expression of SIRT1 caused by miR-217 enhanced Tat-induced phosphorylation of IKK and p65-NFkB and also exacerbated the loss of AMPK phosphorylation triggered by Tat. Our results uncover previously unknown links between Tat and a specific host cell miRNA that targets SIRT1. We also demonstrate that this regulatory mechanism impinges on p65-NFkB and AMPK signaling: two important host cell pathways that influence HIV-1 pathogenesis. Our results also suggest that strategies to augment SIRT1 protein expression by down-regulation of miR-217 may have therapeutic benefits to prevent HIV-1 replication.
