MicroRNAs modulate the angiogenic properties of HUVECs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently come into focus as key posttranscriptional modulators of gene expression. In this work, we addressed whether in vitro angiogenesis is an miRNA-regulated process. We performed large-scale analysis of miRNA expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and found that 15 highly expressed miRNAs have the receptors of angiogenic factors as putative targets. In particular, we demonstrated that miR-221 and miR-222 affect c-Kit expression and, as a consequence, the angiogenic properties of its ligand stem cell factor. Interaction between miR-222 and c-Kit is likely to be part of a complex circuit that controls the ability of endothelial cells to form new capillaries.
