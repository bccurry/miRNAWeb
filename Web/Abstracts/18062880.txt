[Construction of an expression vector for high expression of siRNA]. To construct the vector for efficient expression of siRNA using pre-mir30 backbone. By chemical synthesis method, pre-mir30 backbone introduced an appropriate restriction enzyme site for foreign shRNA inserting was cloned into an expressing vector containing U6 promoter. The silencing efficiency of a new siRNA expressing vector was detected by transfection and Western blot. The new vector containing pre-mir30 backbone expressing siRNA against GFP could markedly inhibit the expression of GFP compared with the vector expressing control siRNA. siRNA expressing vector constructed by pre-mir30 backbone could highly express foreign siRNA.
