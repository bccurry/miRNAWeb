MicroRNA-663 targets TGFB1 and regulates lung cancer proliferation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in many different cellular processes, including metabolism, apoptosis, differentiation, and development. In this study, miR-663 was shown to be highly expressed in patients with lung cancer. Furthermore, miR-663 contributed to lung cancer cell proliferation of by regulating TGFB1, P53, Bax, and Fas directly or indirectly. Our results demonstrated that miR-663 plays an important role in the biology of lung cancer and may be useful in developing therapies targeting genes.
