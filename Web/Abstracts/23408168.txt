MiRNA-200b represses transforming growth factor-1-induced EMT and fibronectin expression in kidney proximal tubular cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise of a novel class of endogenous small noncoding RNAs that frequently downregulate the expression of target genes. Recent reports suggest that miRNA-200b prevents epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells by targeting the E-box binding transcription factors Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2). About 35% of active fibroblasts are derived from EMT which is central to the development of progressive renal fibrosis. Hence, this study was designed to assess the effect of miRNA-200b on transforming growth factor- (TGF-1)-induced fibrotic responses in renal tubular cells. Morphologically, human kidney-2 cells transfected with miRNA-200b retained their epithelial cell characteristics when exposed to TGF-1. miRNA-200b significantly increased E-cadherin (P &lt; 0.001) and reduced fibronectin mRNA and protein expression (both P &lt; 0.01) independent of phospho-Smad2/3 and phospho-p38 and p42/44 signaling. Increased E-cadherin expression was associated with decreased expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2 and repression of fibronectin was mediated through direct targeting of the fibronectin mRNA, demonstrated using pMIR luciferase reporter assay and site-directed mutagenesis. These results suggest that miRNA-200b suppresses TGF-1-induced EMT via inhibition of ZEB1 and ZEB2 and the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin by directing targeting of its 3'UTR mRNA, independent of pathways directly involved in TGF-1 signaling.
