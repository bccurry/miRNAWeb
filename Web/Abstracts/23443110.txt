MiR-218 Impairs Tumor Growth and Increases Chemo-Sensitivity to Cisplatin in Cervical Cancer. MicroRNAs are noncoding RNA molecules of 18-25 nucleotides that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional levels. Recent data revealed that miR-218 played key roles in tumor metastasis. Here, we described the regulation and function of miR-218 in cervical cancer. Overexpression of miR-218 reduced the proliferation of the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa and induced cell apoptosis through the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, it forced expression of miR-218 suppressed tumor growth in the orthotopic mouse model of HeLa cells. Furthermore, miR-218 increased chemosensitivity to cisplatin (CDDP) in vitro. Our results indicated that targeting miR-218 may provide a strategy for blocking the development of cervical cancer.
