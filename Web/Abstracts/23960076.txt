An androgen receptor-microRNA-29a regulatory circuitry in mouse epididymis. MicroRNAs are involved in a number of cellular processes, thus their deregulation is usually apt to the occurrence of diverse diseases. Previous studies indicate the abnormally up-regulated miR-29a is associated with several diseases, such as human acute myeloid leukemia and diabetic, therefore, the proper level of miR-29a is critical for homeostasis. Herein, we observed that miR-29a was repressed by androgen/androgen receptor (AR) signaling in mouse epididymis by targeting a conserved androgen response element (ARE) locating 8 kb upstream of miR-29b1a loci. It is well known that multiple regulatory programs often form a complicated network. Here, we found miR-29a reversely suppressed androgen receptor and its targeting genes by targeting IGF1 and p53 pathways. MiR-29b1a overexpression transgenic mouse displayed a hypoplasia epididymis, partially similar to the phenotype of those mice with impaired androgen-androgen receptor signal system. Taken together, the results demonstrated there was a regulatory circuitry between androgen signaling pathway and miR-29a in mouse epididymis, which may vital for epididymal development and functions.
