Activin and TGF regulate expression of the microRNA-181 family to promote cell migration and invasion in breast cancer cells. MicroRNA-181 (miR-181) is a multifaceted miRNA that has been implicated in many cellular processes such as cell fate determination and cellular invasion. While miR-181 is often overexpressed in human tumors, a direct role for this miRNA in breast cancer progression has not yet been characterized. In this study, we found this miRNA to be regulated by both activin and TGF. While we found no effect of miR-181 modulation on activin/TGF-mediated tumor suppression, our data clearly indicate that miR-181 plays a critical and prominent role downstream of two growth factors, in mediating their pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects in breast cancer cells miR-181 acts as a metastamir in breast cancer. Thus, our findings define a novel role for miR-181 downstream of activin/TGF in regulating their tumor promoting functions. Having defined miR-181 as a critical regulator of tumor progression in vitro, our results thus, highlight miR-181 as an important potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.
