Posttranscriptional regulation of connexin-43 expression. Posttranscriptional regulation of the biosynthesis of connexins, the building blocks of gap junctional channels, may occur by modulation of connexin mRNA stability and translation. To date, few RNA binding proteins and micro-RNAs (miRNAs) affecting connexin expression are known. Two examples of posttranscriptional regulatory processes resulting in the modulation of gap junctional intercellular communication are the stabilization of connexin-43 mRNA by the RNA binding protein HuR and the blocking effect of miRNAs miR-1 and -206 on connexin-43 mRNA translation. These processes may be affected by stressful stimuli, such as by oxidative stress and environmental factors. Moreover, posttranscriptional regulatory circuits may be involved in the pathogenesis of disease and thus provide suitable targets for therapeutic approaches aiming at altering connexin expression.
