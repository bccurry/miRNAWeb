Induction of specific micro Ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) inhibits cutaneous wound healing. Chronic non-healing wounds, such as venous ulcers (VUs), are a widespread and serious medical problem with high morbidity and mortality. The molecular pathology of VUs remains poorly understood, impeding the development of effective treatment strategies. Using mRNA expression profiling of VUs biopsies and computational analysis, we identified a candidate set of microRNAs with lowered target gene expression. Among these candidates, miR-16, -20a, -21, -106a -130a, and -203 were confirmed to be aberrantly over-expressed in a cohort study of 10 VU patients by qPCR and in situ hybridizations. These miRNAs were predicted to target multiple genes important for wound healing, including early growth response factor 3 (EGR3), vinculin and leptin receptor (LepR). Overexpression of the top upregulated, miR-21 and miR-130a, in primary human keratinocytes downregulated expression of the endogenous LepR and EGR3. The luciferase reporter assay verified LepR as a direct target for miR-21 and miR-130a. Both miR-21 and miR-130a delayed epithelialization in acute human skin wound model. Furthermore in vivo overexpression of miR-21 inhibited epithelialization and granulation tissue formation in a rat wound model. Our results identify a novel mechanism in which over-expression of specific set of miRNAs inhibits wound healing, resulting in new potential molecular markers and targets for therapeutic intervention.
