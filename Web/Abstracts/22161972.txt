Biochemical relapse following radical prostatectomy and miR-200a levels in prostate cancer. Radical prostatectomy cures the majority of men with clinically localized disease, but up to 30% of men relapse with rising serum PSA levels. Stage, Gleason grade, and pre-operative PSA levels are associated with outcome but do not accurately predict which individuals will relapse. MicroRNA (miRNA) levels are altered in cancer and are associated with progression of disease. The miR-200 family has roles in prostate cancer. miR-200a levels were measured in 18 radical prostatectomy samples from men who did not relapse and from 18 who did relapse, matched for stage (all T3), grade, and PSA levels. A pair of cancer and normal prostate cell lines derived from the same radical prostatectomy specimen were transfected with miR-200a to determine the effects on growth, wound healing, and invasion. Comparing the matched samples, 11 of the relapsers contained lower, 2 higher and 5 similar levels to the non-relapsers. Transient transfection of miR-200a significantly reduced cell proliferation in prostate cancer cell lines but did not affect invasiveness. miR-200a overexpression reduced prostate cancer cell growth and may have potential, in combination with other markers, in stratifying prostate cancer patients for more intensive monitoring and therapy.
