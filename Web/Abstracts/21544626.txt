Regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling by miR-200b. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling plays an important role in angiogenesis. In the VEGF signaling pathway, the key components are VEGF and its receptors, Flt-1 and KDR. In this study, we show that transfection of synthetic miR-200b reduced protein levels of VEGF, Flt-1, and KDR. In A549 cells, miR-200b targeted the predicted binding sites in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of VEGF, Flt-1, and KDR as revealed by a luciferase reporter assay. When transfected with miR-200b, the ability of HUVECs to form a capillary tube on Matrigel and VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 were significantly reduced. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-200b negatively regulates VEGF signaling by targeting VEGF and its receptors and that miR-200b may have therapeutic potential as an angiogenesis inhibitor.
