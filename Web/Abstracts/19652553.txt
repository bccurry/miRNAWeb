MicroRNA miR-210 modulates cellular response to hypoxia through the MYC antagonist MNT. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway is essential for cell survival under low oxygen and plays an important role in tumor cell homeostasis. We investigated the function of miR-210, the most prominent microRNA upregulated by hypoxia and a direct transcriptional target of HIFs. miR-210 expression was elevated in multiple cancer types and correlated with metastasis of breast and melanoma tumors. miR-210 overexpression in cancer cell lines bypassed hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest and partially reversed the hypoxic gene expression signature. We identified MNT, a known MYC antagonist, as a miR-210 target. MNT mRNA contains multiple miR-210 binding sites in the 3' UTR and its knockdown phenocopied miR-210 overexpression. Furthermore, loss of MYC abolished miR-210-mediated override of hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest. Comparison of miR-210 and MYC overexpression with MNT knockdown signatures also indicated that miR-210 triggered a &quot;MYC-like&quot; transcriptional response. Thus, miR-210 influences the hypoxia response in tumor cells through targeting a key transcriptional repressor of the MYC-MAX network.
