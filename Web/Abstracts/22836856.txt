Changes in miR-143 and miR-21 expression and clinicopathological correlations in pancreatic cancers. Despite advances in clinical management of pancreatic cancer (PC), there is still room for improvement in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumor biology might pinpoint an alteration in expression of miRNAs as new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers. Expression levels of miR-143 and miR-21 and correlations with clinicopathological features were analyzed in 26 matched pairs of tumor and adjacent noncancerous tissue samples collected from patients with PCs, including 18 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) and 8 adenocarcinomas of Vater's papilla (PVACs). Compared to normal tissues, miR-143 was up-regulated in both PDAC and PVAC tumor samples (P = 0.0028 and P = 0.039, respectively). Conversely, alterations in miR-21 expression were significantly different in PDAC versus PVAC samples (P = 0.0049). Tumor levels of miR-21 were associated with preoperative serum levels of CA 19-9 (r = 0.63, P = 0.0022), whereas miR-143 expression was negatively correlated to lymph node spreading (r = -0.64; P = 0.0004). Correlation between miR-143 and miR-21 expression levels in patients with PDAC was observed (r = 0.53, P = 0.023). Deregulation of miR-143 and miR-21 may reflect histological features and biological behavior of different PCs. Association data with clinical parameters might indicate a prognostic significance for miR-143 and miR-21 in PCs.
