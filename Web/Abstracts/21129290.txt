[mir-17-92 cluster and tumor]. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of RNA which has been discovered in recent years and relates with genesis and development of tumors. MiRNA affects the genesis and development of tumors and carries out the function similar to oncogene and antioncogene through regulation of signaling pathway in which target genes involved, thereby the miRNA disregulation plays an important role in oncogenesis. More studies revealed that the miR-17-19 cluster closely correlates with tumorigenesis and has bifunctional effects of oncogene and antioncogene. In this review, the mechanism and function of the miR-17-19 cluster in tumorigenesis are summarized.
