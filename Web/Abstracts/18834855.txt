Effects of miR-34a on cell growth and chemoresistance in prostate cancer PC3 cells. Tumor suppressor p53 transcriptionally regulates expression of microRNA-34a, which confers translational inhibition and mRNA degradation of genes involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. In various cancers, miR-34a expression is lost or reduced. Here, we investigated the role of miR-34a in prostate cancer cell lines. MiR-34a expression was markedly reduced in p53-null PC3 cells and p53-mutated DU145 cells compared with LNCaP cells expressing wild-type p53. In PC3 cell, ectopic expression of miR-34a decreased the SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels as well as protein levels of known direct target genes. Reporter assays revealed that miR-34a-induced SIRT1 inhibition occurred at the transcriptional but not post-transcriptional level despite the presence of a potential miR-34a binding site within its 3'-UTR. Ectopic miR-34a expression resulted in cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition and attenuated chemoresistance to anticancer drug camptothecin by inducing apoptosis, suggesting a potential role of miR-34a for the treatment of p53-defective prostate cancer.
