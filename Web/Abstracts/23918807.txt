A feedback loop consisting of microRNA-23a/27a and the -like globin suppressors KLF3 and SP1 regulates globin gene expression. The developmental stage-specific expression of the human -like globin genes has been studied for decades, and many transcriptional factors as well as other important cis-elements have been identified. However, little is known about the microRNAs that potentially regulate -like globin gene expression directly or indirectly during erythropoiesis. In this study, we show that miR-23a and 27a promote -like globin gene expression in K562 cells and primary erythroid cells through targeting of the transcription factors KLF3 and SP1. Intriguingly, miR-23a and 27a further enhance the transcription of -like globin genes through repression of KLF3 and SP1 binding to the -like globin gene locus during erythroid differentiation. Moreover, KLF3 can bind to the promoter of miR-23a27a24-2 cluster and suppress this microRNA cluster expression. Hence, a positive feedback loop comprised of KLF3 and miR-23a promotes the expression of -like globin genes and miR-23a27a24-2 cluster during erythropoiesis.
