SiLEncing SLE: the power and promise of small noncoding RNAs. In this study, we outline the evidence suggesting that defects in the RNA silencing machinery can lead to the prototypic systemic autoimmune disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and describe the potential for RNA interference to provide novel therapeutic agents. Over the last year, a class of small noncoding RNAs--microRNAs--have been shown to play key roles in immune regulation including T-cell selection in the thymus, B cell affinity maturation and selection in germinal centres, and development of regulatory T cells, suggesting that the microRNA machinery may be crucial in the maintenance of immunological tolerance. Two RNA silencing mechanisms have been shown to be involved in lupus pathogenesis: failed Roquin-mediated repression of inducible costimulatory receptors messenger RNA through miR-101 in roquin(san/san) mice and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic molecule and phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10 in mice transgenic for the miR-17-92 cluster, leading to lymphoproliferation and other lupus manisfestations. MicroRNA array experiments performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells have revealed different expression profiles in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. RNA interference has also been used ex vivo to silence dysregulated T-cell molecules in cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Dysregulation of the RNA silencing machinery has been implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis. Although microRNA profiling may prove to be a useful diagnostic and prognostic tool for a notoriously heterogeneous disease, manipulation of RNA interference emerges as a powerful and potentially specific means to correct dysregulated gene expression in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.
