Antagomir dependent microRNA-205 reduction enhances adhesion ability of human corneal epithelial keratinocytes. To investigate the effect of microRNA-205 reduction by antagomirs on adhesion ability of normal human corneal epithelial keratinocytes (NHCEKs). Antagomir-205, complementary and inhibitory to microRNA-205, was used to suppress endogenous microRNA-205 in NHCEKs. The adhesion ability of treated NHCEKs was then assessed by cell adhesion assay. Immunoblot and immunohistochemistry were conducted to determine the level of two focal adhesion-related proteins, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin (Pax). Phalloidin staining was performed to measure the level of filamentous actin in antagomir-treated NHCEKs. Antagomir-205 markedly reduced the level of microRNA-205 in NHCEKs and significantly enhanced adhesion ability of NHCEKs (P&lt;0.01). Further protein analysis validated that inhibition of microRNA-205 increased the number of phosphorylated FAK and phosphorylated Pax, and decreased filamentous actin. Our findings suggest that microRNA-205 has down-regulating effect on cell motility in NHCEKs.
