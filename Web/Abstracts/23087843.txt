OrbId: Origin-based identification of microRNA targets. MicroRNAs coordinate networks of mRNAs, but predicting specific sites of interactions is complicated by the very few bases of complementarity needed for regulation. Although efforts to characterize the specific requirements for microRNA (miR) regulation have made some advances, no general model of target recognition has been widely accepted. In this work, we describe an entirely novel approach to miR target identification. The genomic events responsible for the creation of individual miR loci have now been described with many miRs now known to have been initially formed from transposable element (TE) sequences. In light of this, we propose that limiting miR target searches to transcripts containing a miR's progenitor TE can facilitate accurate target identification. In this report we outline the methodology behind OrbId (Origin-based identification of microRNA targets). In stark contrast to the principal miR target algorithms (which rely heavily on target site conservation across species and are therefore most effective at predicting targets for older miRs), we find OrbId is particularly efficacious at predicting the mRNA targets of miRs formed more recently in evolutionary time. After defining the TE origins of &gt; 200 human miRs, OrbId successfully generated likely target sets for 191 predominately primate-specific human miR loci. While only a handful of the loci examined were well enough conserved to have been previously evaluated by existing algorithms, we find ~80% of the targets for the oldest miR (miR-28) in our analysis contained within the principal Diana and TargetScan prediction sets. More importantly, four of the 15 OrbId miR-28 putative targets have been previously verified experimentally. In light of OrbId proving best-suited for predicting targets for more recently formed miRs, we suggest OrbId makes a logical complement to existing, conservation based, miR target algorithms.
