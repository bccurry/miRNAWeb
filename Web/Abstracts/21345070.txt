Improvement of prostate cancer detection by integrating the PSA test with miRNA expression profiling. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is limited in prostate cancer diagnosis due to its inaccuracy. A new approach which integrates the PSA test with miRNA profiling was investigated to improve prostate cancer diagnosis. Six prostate cancer-related miRNAs (miR-16, -21, -34c, -101, -125b, -141) were tested in five cultured prostate cell lines and 20 human prostate specimens. We found that the miRNA expression profiles were significantly different between nontumorigenic and tumorigenic cell lines and specimens. Positive predictive value analysis of prostate cancer was increased from 40% to 87.5% by integrating patient PSA blood levels with miR-21 and miR-141 profiles.
