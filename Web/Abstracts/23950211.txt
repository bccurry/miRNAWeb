miR-153 supports colorectal cancer progression via pleiotropic effects that enhance invasion and chemotherapeutic resistance. While microRNAs (miRNAs) have been broadly studied in cancer, comparatively less is understood about their role in progression. Here we report that miR-153 has a dual role during progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) by enhancing cellular invasiveness and platinum-based chemotherapy resistance. MiRNA profiling revealed that miR-153 was highly expressed in a cellular model of advanced stage CRC. Its upregulation was also noted in primary human CRC compared to normal colonic epithelium, and in more advanced CRC stages compared to early stage disease. In CRC patients followed for 50 months, 21/30 patients with high levels of miR-153 had disease progression compared to others in this group with low levels of miR-153. Functional studies revealed that miR-153 upregulation increased CRC invasiveness and resistance to Oxaliplatin and Cisplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations indicated that miR-153 promoted invasiveness indirectly by inducing MMP9 production, whereas drug resistance was mediated directly by inhibiting the Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a. In support of the latter finding, we found that levels of miR-153 and FOXO3a were inversely correlated in matched human CRC specimens. Our findings establishes key roles for miR-153 overexpression in CRC progression, rationalizing therapeutic strategies to target expression of this miRNA for CRC treatment.
