Uncoupling of expression of an intronic microRNA and its myosin host gene by exon skipping. The ancient MYH7b gene, expressed in striated muscle and brain, encodes a sarcomeric myosin and the intronic microRNA miR-499. We find that skipping of an exon introduces a premature termination codon in the transcript that downregulates MYH7b protein production without affecting microRNA expression. Among other genes, endogenous miR-499 targets the 3' untranslated region of the transcription factor Sox6, which in turn acts as a repressor of MYH7b transcriptional activity. Thus, concerted transcription and alternative splicing uncouple the level of expression of MYH7b and miR-499 when their coexpression is not required.
