miR-200c at the nexus of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, resistance to apoptosis, and the breast cancer stem cell phenotype. Decreased expression of miRNAs of the miR-200 family has been implicated in the growth and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Of this family, miR-200c has garnered particular attention as a consequence of its ability to target ZEB1 and ZEB2, mediators of epithelial- mesenchymal transition. An article in the previous issue of Breast Cancer Research identifies additional targets of miR-200c that link increased cancer cell invasiveness, resistance to apoptosis, and induction of breast cancer stem cell characteristics.
