Up-regulated miR155 reverses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition induced by EGF and increases chemo-sensitivity to cisplatin in human Caski cervical cancer cells. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by EGF promotes cervical cancer progression; however, the mechanisms underlying the EGF-induced EMT remain unclear. In this study, we reported that miR155 overexpression suppressed EGF-induced EMT, decreased migration/invasion capacities, inhibited cell proliferation and increased the chemo-sensitivity to DDP in human Caski cervical cancer cells. Further, the overexpression of miR155 increased TP53 expression but reduced SMAD2, and CCND1 expression levels. These data suggest that miR155 negatively regulates EGF-induced EMT. We conclude that miR155 does not act as an oncogene but as a tumour suppressor in Caski cells.
