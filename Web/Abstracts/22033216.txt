Increased microRNA-146a/b, TRAF6 gene and decreased IRAK1 gene expressions in the peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with Sjgren's syndrome. MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a) is a microRNA supposed to regulate innate immune, inflammatory response and antiviral pathway negatively. Recently, its potential use as a biomarker for disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment has become widely investigated. In the current study, we measured the expression of miR-146a/b, and their target genes, IRAK1, IRAK4, TRAF6 in the peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with Sjgren's syndrome (n=21) and healthy controls (n=10) by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We found that both miR-146a and miR-146b, furthermore, the gene of TRAF6 were significantly overexpressed in the Sjgren's patients, whereas the expression of IRAK1 gene was significantly decreased. The expression of IRAK4 did not differ significantly. These results suggest that in the peripheral mononuclear cells of Sjgren's patients, the transcriptional repression of IRAK1 is taking place, whereas the other NF-B pathway regulating gene, TRAF6 is overexpressed. As IRAK1 has been regarded a crucial gene in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, TRAF6 can be a Sjgren's syndrome specific biomarker, confirming and partly explaining the existance of different pathogenic pathways in the two diseases. These observations, however, need still wider confirmations.
