TGF-1 alters microRNA profile in human gastric cancer cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators that play a key role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) is involved in invasion and metastasis in many tumors. In this study, we investigated the microRNAs (miRNA) profiles altered by TGF-1 in gastric cancer (GC) cells. We detected the expression profiles of miRNA by miRNA microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Migration and invasion, wound-healing assay, prediction of miRNA targets, Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis were carried out to determine the role of one selected miRNA, namely miR-193b, in affecting the biological behaviors of GC BGC823 cells. Among 847 human miRNAs in the microarray, three miRNAs (miR-27a, miR-29b-1 and miR-194) were up-regulated and three (miR-574-3p, miR-193b and miR-130b) were down-regulated in BGC823 cells treated with TGF-1 compared with control. miR-193b suppressed the invasion and metastasis of GC cells in vivo and in vitro, and down-regulated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) protein in GC cells. TGF-1 altered miRNA expression profile in BGC823 cells. Among the altered miRNAs, TGF-1 induced the down-regulation of miR-193b, which inhibited cell invasion and metastasis in vivo and in vitro, and down-regulated uPA protein in GC cells.
