Effective delivery of anti-miRNA DNA oligonucleotides by functionalized gold nanoparticles. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are gaining recognition as essential regulators involved in many biological processes, and they are emerging as therapeutic targets for treating disease. Here, we introduce a method for effective delivery of anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs) using functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). To demonstrate the ability of AMOs to silence miRNA, we selected miR-29b, which is known to downregulate myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), a factor responsible for promoting cell survival. We first generated AuNPs coated with cargo DNA, which was then coupled to complementary DNA linked to an antisense miR-29b sequence. When the AuNPs were delivered into HeLa cells, MCL-1 protein and mRNA levels were increased significantly. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was inhibited, proving that AMOs targeting miR-29b were effectively delivered by our innovative AuNP. In addition, we provided evidence that AuNP could deliver other AMOs against miR-21 into two independent cell lines, KGN and 293T, suggesting that the AuNP conjugates can be versatile for any AMO and cell type.
