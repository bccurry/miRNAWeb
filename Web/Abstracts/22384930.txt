MicroRNA-193 pro-proliferation effects for bone mesenchymal stem cells after low-level laser irradiation treatment through inhibitor of growth family, member 5. The enhanced proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be helpful for the clinical translation of cell therapy. Low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) has been demonstrated as regulating MSC proliferation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in various pathophysiologic processes in stem cells, but the role of miRNAs in the LLLI-based promotion of MSC proliferation remains unclear. We found that the proliferation level and cell cycle-associated genes in MSCs were increased after LLLI treatment in a time-dependent manner. Microarray assays revealed subsets of miRNAs to be differentially regulated, and these dynamic changes were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) after LLLI. miR-193 was the most highly up-regulated miRNA, and the change in it was related with the proliferation level. Gain-loss function experiments demonstrated that miR-193 could regulate the proliferation of MSCs, including human's and rat's, but could not affect the apoptosis and differentiation level. Blockade of miR-193 repressed the MSC proliferation induced by LLLI. By qRT-PCR, we found that miR-193, in particular, regulated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) expression. Bioinformatic analyses and luciferase reporter assays revealed that inhibitor of growth family, member 5 (ING5) could be the best target of miR-193 to functionally regulate proliferation and CDK2 activity, and the mRNA and protein level of ING5 was regulated by miR-193. Furthermore, the ING5 inhibited by small interfering RNA (siRNA) could up-regulate the proliferation of MSCs and the expression of CDK2. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that miR-193 plays a critical part in MSC proliferation in response to LLLI stimulation, which is potentially amenable to therapeutic manipulation for clinical application.
