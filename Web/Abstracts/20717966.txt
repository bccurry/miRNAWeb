Expression of micro-RNA-145 is regulated by a highly conserved genomic sequence 3' to the pre-miR. Micro-RNA-145 (miR145), a tumor suppressor miR, dramatically inhibits growth of cancer cells in culture and plays a significant role in human stem cells differentiation. We have isolated a human genomic sequence of 864bp comprising the pre-miR and its flanking sequences. The cloned miR145 genomic sequence expresses a mature miR145 in transfected cells. We show here that flanking sequences on either side of the pre-miR sequence can modulate its expression levels. Surprisingly, a highly conserved sequence 3' to the pre-miR plays a crucial role in miR145 expression.
