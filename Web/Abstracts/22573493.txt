Mir-21 Is Enriched in the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex and Targets col4a1 in Human Granulosa Cell Lines. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding small RNAs that play important roles in a variety of physiological and pathological events. In this study, we performed large-scale profiling of EIF2C2-bound miRNAs in 3 human granulosa-derived cell lines (ie, KGN, HSOGT, and GC1a) by high-throughput sequencing and found that miR-21 accounted for more than 80% of EIF2C2-bound miRNAs, suggesting that it was enriched in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and played a functional role in human granulosa cell (GC) lines. We also found high expression levels of miR-21 in primary human GCs. Assuming that miR-21 target mRNAs are enriched in RISC, we performed cDNA cloning of EIF2C2-bound mRNAs in KGN cells. We identified COL4A1 mRNA as a miR-21 target in the GC lines. These data suggest that miR-21 is involved in the regulation of the synthesis of COL4A1, a component of the basement membrane surrounding the GC layer and granulosa-embedded extracellular structure.
