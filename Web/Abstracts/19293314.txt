A functional genetic variant in microRNA-196a2 is associated with increased susceptibility of lung cancer in Chinese. microRNAs (miRNA) are a new class of non-protein-coding, small RNAs that function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. They participate in diverse biological pathways and function as gene regulators. Recently, we conducted a survey of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in miRNA sequences and reported that, among four SNPs (rs2910164, rs2292832, rs11614913, and rs3746444) in pre-miRNAs, rs11614913 in miR-196a2 might affect mature miR-196a expression and target mRNA-binding activity and was significantly associated with non-small cell lung cancer survival. However, it remains largely unknown whether miRNA SNPs may alter lung cancer susceptibility. In the current study, we evaluated associations between the above four SNPs in pre-miRNAs and lung cancer susceptibility in a case-control study of 1,058 incident lung cancer patients and 1,035 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population. We found that miR-196a2 rs11614913 variant homozygote CC was associated with approximately 25% significantly increased risk of lung cancer compared with their wild-type homozygote TT and heterozygote TC (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.54). However, no significant effects were observed on the association between the other three SNPs and lung cancer risk. These findings suggest that functional SNP rs11614913 in miR-196a2 could also contribute to lung cancer susceptibility.
