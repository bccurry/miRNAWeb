Lack of association of miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism with gastrointestinal cancers: evidence from 10206 subjects. Recent studies on the association between miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and risk of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers showed inconclusive results. Accordingly, we conducted a comprehensive literature search and a meta-analysis to clarify the association. Data were collected from the following electronic databases: Pubmed, Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), with the last report up to February 24, 2012. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were used to assess the strength of association. Ultimately, a total of 12 studies (4,817 cases and 5,389 controls) were found to be eligible for meta-analysis. We summarized the data on the association between miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and risk of GI cancers in the overall population, and performed subgroup analyses by ethnicity, cancer types, and quality of studies. In the overall analysis, there was no evidence of association between miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and the risk of GI cancers (G versus C: OR = 1.07, 95%CI 0.98-1.16, P = 0.14; GG+GC versus CC: OR = 1.14, 95%CI 1.00-1.31, P = 0.05; GG versus GC+CC: OR = 1.06, 95%CI 0.91-1.23, P = 0.47; GG versus CC: OR = 1.17, 95%CI 0.95-1.44, P = 0.13; GC versus CC: OR = 1.14, 95%CI 1.00-1.31, P = 0.05). Similar results were found in the subgroup analyses by ethnicity, cancer types, and quality of studies. This meta-analysis demonstrates that miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism is not associated with GI cancers susceptibility. More well-designed studies based on larger sample sizes and homogeneous cancer patients are needed.
