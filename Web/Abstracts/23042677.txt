The extent of sequence complementarity correlates with the potency of cellular miRNA-mediated restriction of HIV-1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 22-nt non-coding RNAs involved in the regulation of cellular gene expression and potential cellular defense against viral infection. Using in silico analyses, we predicted target sites for 22 human miRNAs in the HIV genome. Transfection experiments using synthetic miRNAs showed that five of these miRNAs capably decreased HIV replication. Using one of these five miRNAs, human miR-326 as an example, we demonstrated that the degree of complementarity between the predicted viral sequence and cellular miR-326 correlates, in a Dicer-dependent manner, with the potency of miRNA-mediated restriction of viral replication. Antagomirs to miR-326 that knocked down this cell endogenous miRNA increased HIV-1 replication in cells, suggesting that miR-326 is physiologically functional in moderating HIV-1 replication in human cells.
