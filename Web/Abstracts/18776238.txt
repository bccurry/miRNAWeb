PNA-peptide conjugates as intracellular gene control agents. Serum-stabilized PNA-internalization peptides (Pip) conjugated to PNA complementary to the 705 aberrant beta-globin splice site are able to correct splicing and increase luciferase production in Hela pLuc705 cells with sub microM EC(50) in the absence of a transfection agent. Inhibition of microRNA-122 in liver cells is achieved by treatment with complementary PNA containing just a few attached Lys residues, again without need of a transfection agent.
