MicroRNA-663 upregulated by oscillatory shear stress plays a role in inflammatory response of endothelial cells. The mechanisms by which oscillatory shear stress (OS) induces, while high laminar shear stress (LS) prevents, atherosclerosis are still unclear. Here, we examined the hypothesis that OS induces inflammatory response, a critical atherogenic event, in endothelial cells by a microRNA (miRNA)-dependent mechanism. By miRNA microarray analysis using total RNA from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) that were exposed to OS or LS for 24 h, we identified 21 miRNAs that were differentially expressed. Of the 21 miRNAs, 13 were further examined by quantitative PCR, which validated the result for 10 miRNAs. Treatment of HUVECs with the miR-663 antagonist (miR-663-locked nucleic acids) blocked OS-induced monocyte adhesion, but not apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of miR-663 increased monocyte adhesion in LS-exposed cells. Subsequent mRNA expression microarray study using HUVECs treated with miR-663-locked nucleic acids and OS revealed 32 up- and 3 downregulated genes, 6 of which are known to be involved in inflammatory response. In summary, we identified 10 OS-sensitive miRNAs, including miR-663, which plays a key role in OS-induced inflammatory responses by mediating the expression of inflammatory gene network in HUVECs. These OS-sensitive miRNAs may mediate atherosclerosis induced by disturbed flow.
