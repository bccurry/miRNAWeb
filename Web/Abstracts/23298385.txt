Correlation of microRNA-372 upregulation with poor prognosis in human glioma. MicroRNA-372 (miR-372) acts as either an oncogenic miRNA or an anti-oncomiR in various human malignancies. However, its roles in gliomas have not been elucidated. To address this problem, we here detected miR-372 expression in human gliomas and non-neoplastic brain tissues by real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. The association of miR-372 expression with clinicopathological factors or prognosis of glioma patients was also statistically analyzed. As the results, miR-372 expression levels were significantly upregulated in glioma tissues compared to the corresponding non-neoplastic brain tissues (P&lt;0.001). In addition, the high miR-372 expression was significantly associated with the advanced pathological grade (P=0.008) and the low Karnofsky performance score (KPS) of glioma patients (P=0.01). Moreover, the overall survival of patients with high miR-372 expression was dramatically shorter than those with low miR-372 expression (P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miR-372 expression was an independent prognostic factor for glioma patients (P=0.008). More importantly, subgroup analyses according to tumor pathological grade revealed that the cumulative overall survival of glioma patients with advanced pathological grades was significantly worse for high miR-372 expression group than for low miR-372 expression group (P&lt;0.001), but no significant difference was found for patients with low pathological grades (P=0.08). Taken together, these data offer the convincing evidence for the first time that miR-372 may act as an oncogenic miRNA in gliomas and represent a potential regulator of aggressive development and a candidate prognostic marker for this malignancy, especially for advanced tumors with high pathological grades.
