The identification of miR-375 as a potential biomarker in distal gastric adenocarcinoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and play an important role in carcinogenesis. Herein, we characterized the global expression of miRNA in distal gastric adenocarcinomas and determined if circulating miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for distal gastric adenocarcinoma. We used a microarray screening system to detect dysregulated miRNAs in distal gastric adenocarcinoma tissues. The expression of a subset of five aberrantly expressed miRNAs (miR-375, -196b, -204, -18b, and -93) were further quantified in an independent set of clinical samples of distal gastric adenocarcinoma by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (rt-qRT-PCR). We also used rt-qRT-PCR to investigate the expression levels of putative miRNA biomarkers in serum and tumor cell lines. In our study, the expression of a subset of microRNAs was altered in distal gastric adenocarcinoma compared to normal tissue, miR-375 was significantly downregulated in distal gastric adenocarcinoma tissues, to a level that was significantly lower than cardia adenocarcinoma (p &lt; 0.05). The circulating serum levels of miR-375 in patients who had distal gastric adenocarcinoma were also much lower than normal controls (p &lt; 0.001). As a biomarker, miR-375 yielded a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.835. The specificity and sensitivity was 80% and 85%, respectively, in the discrimination of distal gastric adenocarcinoma from control, at a normalized cutoff of 0.218. The expression of miR-375 was downregulated both in distal gastric adenocarcinoma tissues and serum of patients with distal gastric adenocarcinoma. These data suggest miR-375 is a potential biomarker for distal gastric adenocarcinoma.
