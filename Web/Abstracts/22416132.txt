Understanding the roles of nuclear A- and B-type lamins in brain development. The nuclear lamina is composed mainly of lamins A and C (A-type lamins) and lamins B1 and B2 (B-type lamins). Dogma has held that lamins B1 and B2 play unique and essential roles in the nucleus of every eukaryotic cell. Recent studies have raised doubts about that view but have uncovered crucial roles for lamins B1 and B2 in neuronal migration during the development of the brain. The relevance of lamins A and C in the brain remains unclear, but it is intriguing that prelamin A expression in the brain is low and is regulated by miR-9, a brain-specific microRNA.
