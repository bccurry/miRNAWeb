Carbamylated albumin stimulates microRNA-146, which is increased in human renal cell carcinoma. Carbamylation is a post-translational modification, the pathophysiological consequences of which remain poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small ribonucleic acids that have emerged as one of the central players in gene expression regulation. This study was designed to determine the effect of carbamylated albumin (cAlb) on the expression of miRNAs. Albumin was carbamylated, and the extent of carbamylation was monitored using trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid. Albumin or cAlb were added to rat mesangial cells (RMCs), and RNA was extracted. miRNA microarray analysis was performed. The expression of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) and microRNA-146b (miR-146b) was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Of 365 miRNAs analyzed, the expression of miR-146a/b was found to be markedly induced by cAlb (miR-146a, 12.75-fold increase; miR-146b, 5.88-fold increase). Real-time RT-PCR analysis confirmed the increased levels of miR-146a/b by cAlb (p&lt;0.05). It was also found that expression levels of miR-146a/b were increased in renal cell carcinoma tumor tissues compared to corresponding non-tumor tissues (p&lt;0.05). Our data suggest that cAlb stimulates miR-146a/b in RMCs, the levels of which are increased in renal cell carcinoma. Further studies on the function of cAlb may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of renal cell carcinoma.
