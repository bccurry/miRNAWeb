MicroRNA212/132 family: molecular transducer of neuronal function and plasticity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing. It is increasingly clear that miRNAs are key regulatory factors for a tight gene expression control. MiRNAs are involved in many aspects of organism development and function, in physiological and pathological conditions. MiRNA expression varies with cell type, tissue and developmental stages. The microRNA212/132 family is one of the most studied miRNA family due to the involvement of miR132 and miR212 in important cellular processes, especially in the brain. MiR132 and miR212 have been implicated in tissue development and in the formation and plasticity of neuronal connections. The main aim of this review is to highlight recent discoveries about miR212/132 family functions and its possible involvement in pathological processes.
