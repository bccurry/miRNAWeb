MicroRNA-195-5p suppresses glucose uptake and proliferation of human bladder cancer T24 cells by regulating GLUT3 expression. It has been reported that expression of glucose transporter member 3 (GLUT3) is up-regulated in bladder cancers. However, the regulating mechanism remains unknown. Here, we assessed whether microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate GLUT3 expression in bladder cancers. In our study, miR-195-5p was identified to directly targeted GLUT3 3'-untranslated region (UTR) in bladder cancer T24 cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)- and miR-195-5p-mediated GLUT3 knockdown experiments revealed that miR-195-5p decreased T24 cells glucose uptake, inhibited cell growth and promoted cell apoptosis through suppression of GLUT3 expression. Therefore, miR-195-5p is a novel and also the first identified miRNA that targets GLUT3, and the aberrant decreased expression of miR-195-5p and consequent GLUT3 up-regulation may contribute to bladder carcinogenesis.
