miRNA-22 suppresses colon cancer cell migration and invasion by inhibiting the expression of T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. Emerging evidence has demonstrated the altered expression of mRNAs in cancer development and progression. In this study, the precise role of miRNA-22 (miR-22) in colon cancer cells was investigated. Upon transfection with a miR-22 expression vector, the viability of HCT-116 human colon cancer cells was significantly reduced and tumor cell migration and invasion capacity were also suppressed. Computational in silico analysis predicted that T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (TIAM1) is a target gene of miR-22. This was confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blotting, which showed that miR-22 expression inhibited TIAM1 mRNA and protein expression, respectively. In addition, the expression of pro-invasive gene matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and pro-angiogenic protein vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were also reduced by miR-22 expression. Collectively, these data suggest that miR-22 may act as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer, most likely by targeting TIAM1 expression.
