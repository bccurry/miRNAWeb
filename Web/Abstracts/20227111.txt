Differential cytogenomics and miRNA signature of the Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Kasumi-1 cell line CD34+38- compartment. The t(8;21) Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) Kasumi-1 cell line with N822K KIT mutation, is a model system for leukemogenesis. As AML initiating cells reside in the CD34(+)CD38(-) fraction, we addressed the refined cytogenomic characterization and miRNA expression of Kasumi-1 cell line and its FACS-sorted subpopulations focussing on this compartment. By conventional cytogenetics, Spectral-Karyotyping and array-CGH the cytogenomic profile of Kasumi-1 cells evidenced only subtle regions differentially represented in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells. Expression profiling by a miRNA platform showed a set of miRNA differentially expressed in paired subpopulations and the signature of miR-584 and miR-182 upregulation in the CD34(+)CD38(-) fraction.
