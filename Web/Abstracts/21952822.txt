Role of microRNAs in endothelial inflammation and senescence. The functionality of endothelial cells is fundamental for the homoeostasis of the vascular system. Increasing evidence shows that endothelial inflammation and senescence contribute greatly to multiple vascular diseases including atherosclerosis. However, little is known regarding the complex upstream regulators of gene expression and translation involved in these responses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a novel class of endogenous, small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate over 30% of genes in a cell via degradation or translational inhibition of their target mRNAs. During the past few years, miRNAs have emerged as key regulators for endothelial biology and function. Endothelial inflammation is critically regulated by miRNAs such as miR-126 and miR-10a in vitro and in vivo. Endothelial aging is additionally controlled by miR-217 and miR-34a. In this review, we summarize the role of miRNAs and their target genes in endothelial inflammation and senescence, and discuss their applicability as drug targets.
