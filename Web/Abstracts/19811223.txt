MicroRNA expression profiling of megakaryocytes in primary myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia. In primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) the megakaryocytic lineage characteristically shows aberrant proliferation and maturation in which the regulatory microRNA (miR) system might be involved. Laser-microdissected PMF and ET megakaryocytes were analysed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) low density arrays comprising 365 microRNAs. The highest megakaryocytic expression levels were observed for miR-223, which is known to be expressed also in granulopoiesis. Cluster analysis revealed a tendency of disease-specific megakaryocytic microRNA expression profiles indicating that a complex shift of microRNA expression appears to be the underlying defect. Increased accumulation of miR-146b was observed in cellular stage PMF (p = 0.0125) but not ET megakaryopoiesis. In conclusion, this is the first microRNA profiling of in situ-derived PMF, ET and normal megakaryocytes.
