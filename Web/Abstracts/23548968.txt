Downregulation of miR-145 expression in oral squamous cell carcinomas and its clinical significance. MicroRNAs have been reported to play roles as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. However, the expression levels of miR-145 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the status of miR-145 expression in OSCC and determine its clinical significance. We examined miR-145 levels in 62 OSCC tissue samples and cell lines by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The relationship between miR-145 expression and clinicopathologic factors of OSCC patients was analyzed. The proportion of miR-145 low expression was 82.26% (51/62) among the 62 OSCC patients, and expression levels of miR-145 in OSCC tissue samples and cell lines were significantly lower than in non-tumor controls. miR-145 expression levels were not significantly associated with age (p = 0.607), sex (p = 0.213), location (p = 0.952), histology (p = 0.603), pT stage (p = 0.305), pTNM stage (p = 0.471), and lymphatic metastasis (p = 1.000). miR-145 may be involved in the early tumorigenesis of oral squamous cells, and might be a potential biomarker in the early diagnosis of OSCC.
