Expression patterns of miR-124, miR-134, miR-132, and miR-21 in an immature rat model and children with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a particularly devastating form of human epilepsy with significant incidence of medical intractability. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate the posttranscriptional expression of protein-coding mRNAs, which may have key roles in the pathogenesis of MTLE development. To study the dynamic expression patterns of brain-specific miR-124 and miR-134 and inflammation-related miR-132 and miR-21, we performed qPCR on the hippocampi of immature rats at 25days of age. Expressions were monitored in the three stages of MTEL and in the control hippocampal tissues corresponding to the same timeframes. A similar expression method was applied to hippocampi obtained from children with MTLE and normal controls. The expression patterns of miR-124 and miR-134 nearly showed the same dynamics in the three stages of MTLE development. On the other hand, miR-132 and miR-21 showed significant upregulation in acute and chronic stages, while in the latent stage, miR-132 was upregulated and miR-21 was downregulated. The four miRs were upregulated in hippocampal tissues obtained from children with MTLE. The significant upregulation of miR-124 and miR-134 in the seizure-related stages and children suggested that both can be potential targets for anticonvulsant drugs in the epileptic developing brains, while the different expression patterns of miR-132 and miR-21 may suggest different functions in MTLE pathogenesis.
