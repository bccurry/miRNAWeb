Low amino acids affect expression of 11-HSD2 in BeWo cells through leptin-activated JAK-STAT and MAPK pathways. Maternal protein restriction diminishes placental 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11-HSD2) activity and causes fetal growth restriction in mammals. However, it is unknown whether such effect was caused directly by nutrient deficiency, or indirectly through the mediation of maternal hormones. In the present study, a human placental cell line (BeWo) was cultured in F12K as control and F12 as low amino acids (LAA) media for 48 h to investigate the effects of amino acids deficiency on 11-HSD2 expression and activity. Despite a significant up-regulation of 11-HSD2 mRNA expression in LAA cells, 11-HSD2 activity and protein content were decreased by 38 and 54%, respectively (P&lt;0.05), indicating a mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation. Among 5 miRNAs targeting 11-HSD2, miR-498 was expressed significantly higher in LAA cells. Leptin concentration was significantly lower (P&lt;0.01) in LAA medium. The mRNA expression of both isoforms of leptin receptor was significantly higher in LAA cells, although no difference was detected at protein level. To further clarify whether leptin is involved in mediating the effect of LAA on 11-HSD2 activity, leptin was supplemented to LAA medium, whereas three specific inhibitors of leptin signaling pathways, WP1066 for JAK-STAT, PD98059 for MAPK and LY294002 for PI3K, respectively were added to control medium. Leptin restored the diminished 11-HSD2 activity in LAA cells, whereas WP1066 (5 nM) and PD98059 (50 nM) significantly decreased 11-HSD2 activity in control cells. In conclusion, the present results indicate that LAA diminishes 11-HSD2 expression and activity in BeWo cells through leptin-activated JAK-STAT and MAPK pathways.
