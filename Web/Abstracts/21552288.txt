miR-135a contributes to paclitaxel resistance in tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Cancer cell resistance to paclitaxel continues to be a major clinical problem. In this study, we utilized microRNA (miRNA) arrays to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs in paclitaxel-resistant cell lines established in vitro. We observed concordant upregulation of miR-135a in paclitaxel-resistant cell lines representing three human malignancies. Subsequently, the role of miRNA-135a was evaluated in an in vivo model of paclitaxel resistance. In this model, mice were inoculated subcutaneously with a non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line and treated with paclitaxel for a prolonged period. In paclitaxel-resistant cell lines, established either in vitro or in vivo, blockage of miR-135a sensitized resistant cell lines to paclitaxel-induced cell death. We further demonstrated a correlation between paclitaxel response and miR-135a expression in paclitaxel-resistant subclones that were established in vivo. The paclitaxel-resistant phenotype of these subclones was maintained upon retransplantation in new mice, as shown by decreased tumor response upon paclitaxel treatment compared with controls. Upregulation of miR-135a was associated with reduced expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC). APC knockdown increased paclitaxel resistance in parental cell lines. Our results indicate that paclitaxel resistance is associated with upregulation of miR-135a, both in vitro and in vivo, and is in part determined by miR-135a-mediated downregulation of APC.
