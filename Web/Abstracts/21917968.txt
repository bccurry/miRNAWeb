HepG2 cells expressing microRNA miR-122 support the entire hepatitis C virus life cycle. The liver-specific microRNA miR-122 is required for efficient hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication both in cell culture and in vivo. In addition, nonhepatic cells have been rendered more efficient at supporting this stage of the HCV life cycle by miR-122 expression. This study investigated how miR-122 influences HCV replication in the miR-122-deficient HepG2 cell line. Expression of this microRNA in HepG2 cells permitted efficient HCV RNA replication and infectious virion production. When a missing HCV receptor is also expressed, these cells efficiently support viral entry and thus the entire HCV life cycle.
