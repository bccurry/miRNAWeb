[Epigenetic inactivation of microRNA genes in mammary carcinoma]. This study addresses the question whether microRNA genes are affected by aberrant hypermethylation and subsequent transcriptional repression in human breast cancer. All known human microRNA genes were screened for the association with CpG islands using different algorithms. Methylation status of candidate genes was assessed in a panel of breast cancer cell lines, various normal tissue samples and primary breast cancer specimen using COBRA, bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing. Transcriptional silencing was measured by real-time RT-PCR. The effect of demethylation on microRNA gene expression was analysed in breast cancer cell lines after treatment with the DNMT inhibitor 5'-deoxy-2-azacytidine. Aberrant hypermethylation was shown for mir-9-1, mir-124a3, mir-148, mir-152, and mir-663 in 34-86% of cases in a series of 71 primary human breast cancer specimens. miRNA gene hypermethylation correlated strongly with methylation of known tumour suppressor genes (p = 0.003). After treatment of various breast cancer cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine, reduction of mir-9-1 gene methylation and concomitant reactivation of expression could be observed. For the mir-9-1 gene, which is already hypermethylated in preinvasive intraductal lesions, a good correlation between quantitative methylation level and reduction of expression could be demonstrated in a subset of primary human breast cancer specimen (r = 0.8). In addition to deletion and mutation, microRNA genes are also affected by aberrant hypermethylation in human breast cancer. This epigenetic inactivation is frequent and occurs early during breast cancer progression.
