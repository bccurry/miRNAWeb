The role of microRNAs in hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha expression and transactivation. Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4 is a key member of the transcription factor network regulating hepatocyte differentiation and function. Genetic and molecular evidence suggests that expression of HNF-4 is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. Activation of HNF-4A gene involves the interaction of distinct sets of transcription factors and co-transcription factors within enhancer and promoter regions. Here we study the inhibitory effect of microRNAs (miRNAs) on the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of HNF-4A mRNA. The potential recognition elements of a set of miRNAs were identified utilizing bioinformatics analysis. The family members of miR-34 and miR-449, including miR-34a, miR-34c-5p and miR-449a, share the same target elements located at two distinct locations within the 3'-UTR of HNF-4A. The over-expression of miR-34a, miR-34c-5p or miR-449a in HepG2 cells led to a significant decrease in the activity of luciferase reporter carrying 3'-UTR of HNF-4A. The repressive effect on reporter activity was partially or fully eliminated when one or two of the binding site(s) for miR-34a/miR-34c-5p/miR-449a were deleted within the 3'-UTR. The protein level of HNF-4 was dramatically reduced by over-expression of miR-34a, miR-34c-5p and miR-449a, which correlates with a decrease in the binding activity of HNF-4 and transactivation of HNF-4 target genes. These results suggest that the recognition sites of miR-34a, miR-34c-5p and miR-449a within 3'-UTR of HNF-4A are functional. The mechanism of down-regulation of the binding activity and transactivation of HNF-4 by the miRNAs involves the decrease in HNF-4 protein level via miRNAs selectively targeting HNF-4A 3'-UTR, leading to the translational repression of HNF-4 expression.
