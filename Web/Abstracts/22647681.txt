miRNA-101: a potential target for tumor therapy. microRNAs are genomically encoded small non-coding RNAs that regulate genetic information by controlling stability or translation of mRNAs. Down-regulated expression of microRNA-101 (miRNA-101) has been found in a variety of cancers, and associated with the invasion and progression of malignancies. Recent advances in the understanding of miRNA-101 biogenesis, target recognition and participation in regulatory pathways demonstrate a role for miRNA-101 in tumorigenesis. miRNA-101 gene therapy is of great potentiality to be a new modality for treatment of cancers.
