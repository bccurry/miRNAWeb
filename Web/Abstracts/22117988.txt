The expression and clinical significance of GTP-binding RAS-like 3 (ARHI) and microRNA 221 and 222 in prostate cancer. Globally, prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among men and there is no biomarker for defining tumour invasion and progression. Guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding RAS-like 3 (ARHI) is a tumour suppressor gene that has been found to be downregulated in the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. MicroRNA 221 and 222 have been shown to regulate ARHI expression negatively. This study evaluated tissue samples from patients with prostate cancer (n = 35) that were designated as aggressive or non-aggressive according to their Gleason grade. Expression of ARHI and microRNA 221 and 222 was measured by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The level of ARHI mRNA was significantly lower in aggressive compared with non-aggressive prostate cancer tissue samples. In contrast, microRNA 221 and 222 levels were significantly higher in aggressive compared with non-aggressive prostate cancer tissue samples. Whether ARHI and microRNA 221 and 222 could be considered as biomarkers for disease progression in prostate cancer requires further investigation.
