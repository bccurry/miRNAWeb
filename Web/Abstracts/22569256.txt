The inhibitory effect of miRNA-1 on ET-1 gene expression. There is a close correlation between endothelin-1 (ET-1) and microRNA-1 (miRNA-1) expression in the heart, but whether ET-1 expression is regulated by miRNA-1 warrants further research. Our results revealed multiple clues suggesting that miRNA-1 may participate in inhibiting ET-1 gene expression. The inhibitory effect of miRNA-1 on recombinant luciferase reporter gene was mediated by the target sequence at the 127th nucleotide on ET-1 3'UTR. We further confirmed that miRNA-1 could inhibit endogenous ET-1 gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Our study provides a new perspective on the regulatory mechanism of ET-1 gene.
