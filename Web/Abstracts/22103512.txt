Cell autonomous and systemic factors in progeria development. Progeroid laminopathies are accelerated aging syndromes caused by defects in nuclear envelope proteins. Accordingly, mutations in the LMNA gene and functionally related genes have been described to cause HGPS (Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome), MAD (mandibuloacral dysplasia) or RD (restrictive dermopathy). Functional studies with animal and cellular models of these syndromes have facilitated the identification of the molecular alterations and regulatory pathways involved in progeria development. We have recently described a novel regulatory pathway involving miR-29 and p53 tumour suppressor which has provided valuable information on the molecular components orchestrating the response to nuclear damage stress. Furthermore, by using progeroid mice deficient in ZMPSTE24 (zinc metalloprotease STE24 homologue) involved in lamin A maturation, we have demonstrated that, besides these abnormal cellular responses to stress, dysregulation of the somatotropic axis is responsible for some of the alterations associated with progeria. Consistent with these observations, pharmacological restoration of the somatotroph axis in these mice delays the onset of their progeroid features, significantly extending their lifespan and supporting the importance of systemic alterations in progeria progression. Finally, we have very recently identified a novel progeroid syndrome with distinctive features from HGPS and MAD, which we have designated NGPS (Nstor-Guillermo progeria syndrome) (OMIM #614008). This disorder is caused by a mutation in BANF1, a gene encoding a protein with essential functions in the assembly of the nuclear envelope, further illustrating the importance of the nuclear lamina integrity for human health and providing additional support to the study of progeroid syndromes as a valuable source of information on human aging.
