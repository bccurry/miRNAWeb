Small RNA sequencing reveals microRNAs that modulate angiotensin II effects in vascular smooth muscle cells. Angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated vascular smooth muscle cell dysfunction plays a critical role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this process is unclear. We used small RNA deep sequencing to profile Ang II-regulated miRNAs in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and evaluated their role in VSMC dysfunction. Sequencing results revealed several Ang II-responsive miRNAs, and bioinformatics analysis showed that their predicted targets can modulate biological processes relevant to cardiovascular diseases. Further studies with the most highly induced miR-132 and miR-212 cluster (miR-132/212) showed time- and dose-dependent up-regulation of miR-132/212 by Ang II through the Ang II Type 1 receptor. We identified phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) as a novel target of miR-132 and demonstrated that miR-132 induces monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 at least in part via PTEN repression in rat VSMC. Moreover, miR-132 overexpression enhanced cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation via RASA1 (p120 Ras GTPase-activating protein 1) down-regulation, whereas miR-132 inhibition attenuated Ang II-induced CREB activation. Furthermore, miR-132 up-regulation by Ang II required CREB activation, demonstrating a positive feedback loop. Notably, aortas from Ang II-infused mice displayed similar up-regulation of miR-132/212 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, supporting in vivo relevance. In addition, microarray analysis and reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR validation revealed additional novel miR-132 targets among Ang II-down-regulated genes implicated in cell cycle, motility, and cardiovascular functions. These results suggest that miR132/212 can serve as a novel cellular node to fine-tune and amplify Ang II actions in VSMC.
