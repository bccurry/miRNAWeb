Regulation of transcription factor E2F3a and its clinical relevance in ovarian cancer. Recently we showed an integral epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-E2F3a signaling path, in which E2F3a was found to be essential in EGFR-mediated proliferation in ovarian cancer cells. The present work evaluates the clinical relevance of this novel axis and of E2F3a itself in a large set of 130 ovarian cancer specimens. For this purpose E2F3a and its counterpart, E2F3b, were measured by RT-PCR and activated EGFR was assessed by immunohistochemistry. When compared with healthy control tissue, both E2F3 isoforms were overexpressed in the cancers, but only E2F3a expression correlated with tumor stage (=0.349, P=0.0001) and residual disease (=0.254, P=0.004). Univariate survival analyses showed E2F3a and activated EGFR to be associated with poor PFS and OS. Furthermore, a strong, positive correlation between activated EGFR and E2F3a expression was shown (P=0.0001). We further identified two EGFR-independent mechanisms that regulate E2F3a expression, namely one, acting by promoter methylation of miR-34a, which by its physical interaction with E2F3a transcripts causes their degradation, and the second based on 6p22 gene locus amplification. MiRIDIAN-based knockdown and induction of miR-34a evidenced a direct regulatory link between miR-34a and E2F3a, and the tumor-suppressive character of miR-34a was documented by its association with improved survival. Although, 6p22 gene locus amplification was detected in a significant number of ovarian cancer specimens, 6p22 ploidy was not relevant in predicting survival. In Cox regression analysis, E2F3a, but not activated EGFR or miR-34a expression, retained independent prognostic significance (PFS: hazards ratio 3.785 (1.326-9.840), P=0.013; OS: hazards ratio 4.651 (1.189-15.572), P=0.013). These clinical findings highlight the relevance of E2F3a in the biology of ovarian cancer. Moreover, identification of EGFR-independent mechanisms in E2F3a control can be helpful in explaining the non-responsiveness of therapeutic EGFR targeting in ovarian cancer.
