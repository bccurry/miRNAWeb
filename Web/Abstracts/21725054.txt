MicroRNA function in myeloid biology. The past 5 years have seen an explosion of knowledge about miRNAs and their roles in hematopoiesis, cancer, and other diseases. In myeloid development, there is a growing appreciation for both the importance of particular miRNAs and the unique features of myelopoiesis that are being uncovered by experimental manipulation of miRNAs. Here, we review in detail the roles played by 4 miRNAs, miR-125, miR-146, miR-155, and miR-223 in myeloid development and activation, and correlate these roles with their dysregulation in disease. All 4 miRNAs demonstrate effects on myelopoiesis, and their loss of function or overexpression leads to pathologic phenotypes in the myeloid lineage. We review their functions at distinct points in development, their targets, and the regulatory networks that they are embedded into in the myeloid lineage.
