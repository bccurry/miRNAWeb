Increased Expression of MicroRNA-221 in Gastric Cancer and Its Clinical Significance. MicroRNA-221 (miR-221), which is located on chromosome X, is an oncogenic microRNA that is involved in several human malignancies. This study aimed to characterize the role of miR-221 in the initiation and malignant progression of gastric cancer. The level of miR-221 expression in 92 pairs of primary gastric tumour tissue and adjacent nontumour tissue was quantified by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The relationship between the miR-221 level and clinicopathological features was explored. MiR-221 was up-regulated in 88% (81/92) of gastric cancer tissue samples compared with their paired adjacent nontumour tissue samples. High expression of miR-221 showed a significant correlation with advanced tumour-node-metastasis stage, local invasion and lymphatic metastasis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses revealed that miR-221 overexpression was an unfavourable prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with gastric cancer. These findings suggest that miR-221 is a novel prognostic indicator in gastric cancer and may be a potential target for diagnosis and gene therapy.
