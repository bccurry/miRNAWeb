Resistance of human hepatitis delta virus RNAs to dicer activity. The endonuclease dicer cleaves RNAs that are 100% double stranded and certain RNAs with extensive but &lt;100% pairing to release approximately 21-nucleotide (nt) fragments. Circular 1,679-nt genomic and antigenomic RNAs of human hepatitis delta virus (HDV) can fold into a rod-like structure with 74% pairing. However, during HDV replication in hepatocytes of human, woodchuck, and mouse origin, no approximately 21-nt RNAs were detected. Likewise, in vitro, purified recombinant dicer gave &lt;0.2% cleavage of unit-length HDV RNAs. Similarly, rod-like RNAs of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) and avocado sunblotch viroid (ASBVd) were only 0.5% cleaved. Furthermore, when a 66-nt hairpin RNA with 79% pairing, the putative precursor to miR-122, which is an abundant liver micro-RNA, replaced one end of HDV genomic RNA, it was poorly cleaved, both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, this 66-nt hairpin, in the absence of appended HDV sequences, was &gt;80% cleaved in vitro. Other 66-nt hairpins derived from one end of genomic HDV, PSTVd, or ASBVd RNAs were also cleaved. Apparently, for unit-length RNAs of HDV, PSTVd, and ASBVd, it is the extended structure with &lt;100% base pairing that confers significant resistance to dicer action.
