TGF- induces miR-182 to sustain NF-B activation in glioma subsets. The strength and duration of NF-B signaling are tightly controlled by multiple negative feedback mechanisms. However, in cancer cells, these feedback loops are overridden through unclear mechanisms to sustain oncogenic activation of NF-B signaling. Previously, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-30e* directly represses IB expression and leads to hyperactivation of NF-B. Here, we report that miR-182 was overexpressed in a different set of gliomas with relatively lower miR-30e* expression and that miR-182 directly suppressed cylindromatosis (CYLD), an NF-B negative regulator. This suppression of CYLD promoted ubiquitin conjugation of NF-B signaling pathway components and induction of an aggressive phenotype of glioma cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that TGF- induced miR-182 expression, leading to prolonged NF-B activation. Importantly, the results of these experiments were consistent with an identified significant correlation between miR-182 levels with TGF- hyperactivation and activated NF-B in a cohort of human glioma specimens. These findings uncover a plausible mechanism for sustained NF-B activation in malignant gliomas and may suggest a new target for clinical intervention in human cancer.
