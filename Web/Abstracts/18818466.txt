Anorganic bovine bone and a silicate-based synthetic bone activate different microRNAs. Bio-Oss (BO), composed of anorganic bovine bone, is widely used in several bone regeneration procedures in oral surgery. PerioGlas (PG) is an alloplastic material that has been used for grafting of periodontal osseous defects since the 1990s. However, how these biomaterials alter osteoblast activity to promote bone formation is poorly understood. We attempted to address this question by using microRNA microarray techniques to investigate differences in translational regulation in osteoblasts exposed to BO and PG. By using miRNA microarrays containing 329 probes designed from human miRNA sequences, we investigated miRNAs whose expression was significantly modified in an osteoblast-like cell line (MG-63) cultured with BO vs PG. Three up-regulated miRNAs (mir-337, mir-200b, mir-377) and 4 down-regulated miRNAs (mir-130a, mir-214, mir-27a, mir-93) were identified. Our results indicated that BO and PG act on different miRNAs. Globally, PG causes activation of bone-forming signaling, whereas BO also activates cartilage-related pathways.
