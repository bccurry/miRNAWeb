MiR-214 reduces cell survival and enhances cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity via down-regulation of Bcl2l2 in cervical cancer cells. MiR-214 has been shown to inhibit cell growth, migration and invasion. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of miR-214 reduces cell survival, induces apoptosis and enhances sensitivity to cisplatin through directly inhibiting Bcl2l2 expression in cervical cancer HeLa and C-33A cells. Further analysis reveals that apoptosis induced by miR-214 is correlated with increased expression of Bax, caspase-9, caspase-8 and caspase-3. Moreover, we show that miR-214 is regulated by DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-214 might be a candidate target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat cervical cancer.
