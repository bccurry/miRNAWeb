NOS antagonism using viral vectors as an experimental strategy: implications for in vivo studies of cardiovascular control and peripheral neuropathies. Nitric oxide, a free gaseous signalling molecule, has attracted the attention of numerous biologists and has been implicated in the regulation of the cardiovascular, nervous and immune system. However, the cellular mechanisms mediating nitric oxide modulation remain unclear. Upregulation by gene over-expression or down-regulation by gene inactivation of nitric oxide synthase has generated quantitative changes in abundance thereby permitting functional insights. We have tested and proved that genetic nitric oxide synthase antagonism using viral vectors, particularly with dominant negative mutants and microRNA 30-based short hairpin RNA, is an efficient and effective experimental approach to manipulate nitric oxide synthase expression both in vitro and in vivo.
