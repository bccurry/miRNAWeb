[Expression and its clinical significance of hsa-miR-155 in serum of endometrial cancer]. to investigate the expression of the hsa-miR-155 in serum of endometrial cancer and its clinical significance. collected 44 cases blood specimens before surgery operation from Sep. 2008 to Dec. 2009, and collected 12 cases blood specimens from the health of volunteers in comparison. Real time quantity PCR was used to detect the expression of hsa-miR-155 in those specimens and analyzed clinical pathological with the expression of hsa-mir-155 in endometrial cancer. the expression of hsa-miR-155 was (3.9  0.7) in endometrial cancer, which was significantly higher than that in control group (P &lt; 0.01). The expressions of hsa-miR-155 were (3.7  0.6), (3.9  0.6) and (3.7  0.6) times in well, moderately and poorly differentiated endometrial cancer, respectively, while there were not significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). The expressions were (3.8  0.6) and (3.9  0.6) times between endometrioid adenocarcinoma and non-endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and there were significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). The expressions were (2.1  0.4) and (5.6  0.8) times in stage I - II and III - IV endometrial cancer, respectively, in which there were significant difference (P &lt; 0.05). The expressions of hsa-miR-155 were (5.5  0.5) and (1.9  0.2) times between lymph node metastasis and without lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer, in which there were significant difference (P &lt; 0.01). Hsa-miR-155 may play an important role in the proliferation, and metastasis of endometrial cancer, which may be a indicator in the diagnosis and prognosis of endometrial cancer and may be used as a predictive biomarker.
