Secreted miRNAs suppress atherogenesis. Endothelial-vascular smooth muscle cell communication has a critical role in cardiovascular homeostasis and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. A study now demonstrates extracellular-vesicle-mediated transfer of the atheroprotective microRNAs miR-143/145 between endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, providing compelling evidence that intercellular transport of miRNAs can influence a pathological process, namely atherosclerosis.
