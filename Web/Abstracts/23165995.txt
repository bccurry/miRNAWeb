miRNAs, polyphenols, and chronic disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, approximately 18-25 nucleotides in length, that modulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Thousands of miRNAs have been described, and it is thought that they regulate some aspects of more than 60% of all human cell transcripts. Several polyphenols have been shown to modulate miRNAs related to metabolic homeostasis and chronic diseases. Polyphenolic modulation of miRNAs is very attractive as a strategy to target numerous cell processes and potentially reduce the risk of chronic disease. Evidence is building that polyphenols can target specific miRNAs, such as miR-122, but more studies are necessary to discover and validate additional miRNA targets.
