Do Opioids Activate Latent HIV-1 by Down-Regulating Anti-HIV microRNAs? Researchers have recently demonstrated the presence of anti-HIV-1 microRNAs (miR-28, miR-125b, miR-150, miR-223, and miR-382) in monocytes, macrophages, and CD4+ T cells, which are the primary targets of HIV infection. These miRNAs appear to regulate the level of infectivity of HIV-1 in the target cells, and thus have an impact on HIV-1 latency. The levels of these miRNAs are significantly higher in resting CD4+ T cells than those in active CD4+ T cells, whereas HIV-1 infectivity is greater in active than in resting CD4+ T cells. Similarly, the levels of these miRNAs are significantly higher in monocytes than in macrophages, whereas HIV-1 infectivity is greater in macrophages than in monocytes. Down-regulation or inhibition of the activity of these miRNAs can promote replication of latent HIV-1 in resting CD4+ T cells and in monocytes. Recently, morphine was shown to down regulate the expression of anti-HIV miRNAs (miRNA-28, 125b, 150, and 382) in cultured human monocytes and this effect of morphine was mediated via activation of mu opioid receptors (MOR). In addition, levels of these anti-HIV miRNAs were significantly lower in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from heroin-dependent subjects than those from control subjects. These findings raise an important question: Does morphine have potential to activate latent HIV-1 in resting CD4+ T cells and macrophages, including microglia of human subjects maintained on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)? Further research is required to answer this question.
