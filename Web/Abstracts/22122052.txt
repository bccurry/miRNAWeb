Epigenetics in Waldenstrm's macroglobulinemia. Waldenstrm's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a low-grade B-cell lymphoma characterized by the presence of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow and a serum monoclonal immunoglobulin, known as IgM, in the circulation. Although indolent, it remains incurable with a median overall survival of 5-6 years, and most patients succumb to disease progression. Cytogenetic and molecular studies on gene-expression analysis at the mRNA level have demonstrated minimal changes in WM cells. Therefore, multilevel characterization of this disease at the genetic and epigenetic level is required to improve our understanding of the underlying molecular changes that lead to the initiation and progression of this disease. In this study it has been demonstrated that WM patients present with a specific miRNA signature. Among deregulated miRNAs, miR-155 and miR-9* play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of this disease.
