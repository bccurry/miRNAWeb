Histone deacetylase inhibition overcomes drug resistance through a miRNA-dependent mechanism. The treatment of specific tumor cell lines with poly- and oligoamine analogues results in a super-induction of polyamine catabolism that is associated with cytotoxicity; however, other tumor cells demonstrate resistance to analogue treatment. Recent data indicate that some of these analogues also have direct epigenetic effects. We therefore sought to determine the effects of combining specific analogues with an epigenetic targeting agent in phenotypically resistant human lung cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that the histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275 when combined with (N1, N11)-bisethylnorspermine (BENSpm) or (N1, N12)-bis(ethyl)-cis-6,7-dehydrospermine tetrahydrochloride (PG-11047) synergistically induces the polyamine catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT), a major determinant of sensitivity to the antitumor analogues. Evidence indicates that the mechanism of this synergy includes reactivation of miR-200a, which targets and destabilizes kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) mRNA, resulting in the translocation and binding of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) to the polyamine-responsive element of the SSAT promoter. This transcriptional stimulation combined with positive regulation of SSAT mRNA and protein by the analogues results in decreased intracellular concentrations of natural polyamines and growth inhibition. The finding that an epigenetic targeting agent is capable of inducing a rate-limiting step in polyamine catabolism to overcome resistance to the antitumor analogues represents a completely novel chemotherapeutic approach. This is also the first demonstration of miRNA-mediated regulation of the polyamine catabolic pathway. Furthermore, the individual agents used in this study have been investigated clinically; therefore, translation of these combinations into the clinical setting holds promise.
