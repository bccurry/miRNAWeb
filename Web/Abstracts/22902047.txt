MicroRNAs and autoimmunity. The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of many physiological and pathological processes has been intensely studied in recent years. Some miRNAs, such as miR-146a and miR-182, play a dominant role in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses, respectively. Many miRNAs are reportedly deregulated in autoimmune diseases, but miR-146a in particular seems to be consistently altered. The overexpression or underexpression of miRNAs can influence specific targets and pathways, leading to autoimmune disease phenotypes, and this is supported also by some in vivo studies. Targeting miRNAs could represent a valid future therapeutic option for autoimmune diseases.
