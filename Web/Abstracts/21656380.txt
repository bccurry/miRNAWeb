MiR-106a inhibits glioma cell growth by targeting E2F1 independent of p53 status. MicroRNAs are single-stranded small non-coding RNA molecules which regulate mammalian cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis by altering the expression of other genes and play a role in tumor genesis and progression. MiR-106a is upregulated in several types of malignancies and provides a pro-tumorigenic effect. However, its role in glioma is largely unknown. Our findings demonstrate that the low expression of miR-106a in human glioma specimens is significantly correlated with high levels of E2F1 protein and high-grade glioma. Here, we present the first evidence that miR-106a provides a tumor-suppressive effect via suppressing proliferation of and inducing apoptosis in human glioma cells. We further show that E2F1 is a direct functional target of miR-106a, suggesting that the effect of miR-106a on the glioma suppressive effect may result from inhibition of E2F1 via post-transcriptional regulation. In addition, our results reveal that miR-106a can increase p53 expression via E2F1 inhibition, whereas the effect of miR-106a on the proliferation of glioma cells is independent of p53 status. Further investigations will focus on the therapeutic use of miR-106a-mediated antitumor effects in glioma.
