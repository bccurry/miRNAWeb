[Role of microRNA in regulation of innate immunity mechanisms]. New class of regulatory molecules--microRNA--is of special interest now. Large amount of data about function of these molecules in immune response regulation is accumulated. Functions of several microRNA molecules (miRNA-146, miRNA-155, miRNA-223) contributing to such mechanisms of innate immunity regulation as transmission of signals from receptors, maturation, differentiation and proliferation of innate immunity cells are described in this review. It is necessary to underline the perspective of these molecules for development of drugs for correction of innate immunity abnormalities.
