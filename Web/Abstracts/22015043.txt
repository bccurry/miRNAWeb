The interactions between MicroRNA-200c and BRD7 in endometrial carcinoma. Increased expression of miR-200c was recently reported in endometrial carcinoma compared with normal tissues. In this study, we evaluated the role of miR-200c in cell growth and drug sensitivity in endometrial carcinoma and investigated the underlying mechanisms. The expression of miR-200c in human endometrial tissues was detected by quantitative RT-PCR. The transfection with anti-miRNA (anti-miR) or the premature form of miRNA (pre-miR) was performed to regulate the level of expression of miRNA-200c in endometrial carcinoma cells, HEC-1A and Ishikawa. To identify the target genes for miR-200c, we performed mRNA microarray after pre-miR-200c transfection in HEC-1A cells. We found that miR-200c expression was increased in endometrial carcinoma compared with normal endometrial tissues. Anti-miR or pre-miR-200c could regulate cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis and affect cytotoxicity in endometrial cancer cells. Through mRNA microarray analysis, we found that miR-200c inhibits the expression of BRD7, which was recently reported as a potential tumor suppressor gene. MiR-200c regulated the translocation of -catenin from the cytoplasm to the nucleus via inhibition of BRD7, resulting in increased expression of its transcriptional target genes, cyclinD1 and c-myc. The interaction between miR-200c and BRD7 might have important roles in controlling growth of endometrial of cancer cells and suggest a novel target pathway for treatment of this cancer.
