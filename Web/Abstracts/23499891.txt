Tumor-suppressive microRNA-145 targets catenin -1 to regulate Wnt/-catenin signaling in human colon cancer cells. The constitutive activation of Wnt/-catenin signaling plays a central role in colon cancer. MiR-145 was earlier identified as one of the microRNAs (miRNAs) down-regulated in colon cancer cells. However, the role of miR-145 in the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that miR-145 played a pivotal role in the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway by perturbing the intracellular translocation of -catenin in human colon cancer cells. The ectopic expression of miR-145 inhibited the growth of DLD-1 cells by disturbing -catenin translocation into the nucleus, thereby leading to the down-regulation of LEF/TCF transcriptional target genes c-Myc and CyclinD1. We further demonstrated that miR-145 directly targeted catenin -1, contributing to the aberrant translocation of -catenin through impaired nuclear shuttling with p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4). These findings uncover a novel role of miR-145 in modulating intracellular translocation of -catenin on Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway.
