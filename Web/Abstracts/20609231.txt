Expression of miRNA-106b in conventional renal cell carcinoma is a potential marker for prediction of early metastasis after nephrectomy. MicroRNAs are endogenously expressed regulatory noncoding RNAs. Previous studies have shown altered expression levels of several microRNAs in renal cell carcinoma. We examined the expression levels of selected microRNAs in 38 samples of conventional renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and 10 samples of non-tumoral renal parenchyma using TaqMan real-time PCR method. The expression levels of miRNA-155 (p &lt; 0.0001), miRNA-210 (p &lt; 0.0001), miRNA-106a (p &lt; 0.0001) and miRNA-106b (p &lt; 0.0001) were significantly over-expressed in tumor tissue, whereas the expression of miRNA-141 (p &lt; 0.0001) and miRNA-200c (p &lt; 0.0001) were significantly decreased in RCC samples. There were no significant differences between expression levels of miRNA-182 and miRNA-200b in tumor samples and renal parenchyma. Our data suggest that expression levels of miRNA-106b are significantly lower in tumors of patients who developed metastasis (p = 0.030) and miR-106b is a potential predictive marker of early metastasis after nephrectomy in RCC patients (long-rank p = 0.032). We have confirmed previous observations obtained by miRNA microarray analysis using standardized real-time PCR method. For the first time, we have identified a prognostic significance of miRNA-106b, which, after validation on a larger group of patients, maybe useful as a promising biomarker in patients with RCC.
