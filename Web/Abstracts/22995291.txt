A subset of circulating microRNAs are predictive for cardiac death after discharge for acute myocardial infarction. To investigate the prognostic impact of circulating microRNAs (miRs) in patients who survived acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we compared the circulating miR signature at the time of survival discharge among samples in the serum bank of the Osaka Acute Coronary Insufficiency Study. Using a high-throughput array consisting of 667 miRs, 11 miRs were found to be differentially expressed in the serum among patients at high-risk for cardiac death. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed that the serum levels of miR-155 and miR-380* were approximately 4- and 3-fold higher, respectively, in patients who experienced cardiac death within 1 year after discharge. Accordingly, a subset of circulating miRs might be predictive for cardiac death in post-AMI patients.
