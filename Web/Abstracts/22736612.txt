Development of retinal pigment epithelium from human parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells and microRNA signature. PURPOSE. To investigate the potential of human parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells (hPESCs) to differentiate into retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, and identify development-regulating microRNAs (miRNAs).METHODS. RPE cells were derived from hPESCs. The expression of markers and miRNA expression profiles during differentiation were studied by immunocytochemistry, real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and miRNA expression array at three time points. Human fetal RPE (hfRPE) cells were also analyzed. The target genes of candidate miRNAs were then validated. RESULTS. hPESC-derived RPE cells exhibited similar morphology and pigmentation to hfRPE cells. The expression of markers during differentiation indicated that the hPESC-derived RPE cells were immature. Most specific miRNAs played a role at some time point during the differentiation and maturation of RPE from hPESCs, except for two miRNAs (miR-204 and the miR-302 family). miR-204 was up-regulated and miR-302 was down-regulated throughout the process. Subsequently, pigmented clusters and RPE signature gene expression significantly increased in miR-204 overexpression group and miR-302 inhibition group compared with the control groups. CTNNBIP1 and TGFBR2 were confirmed to be the target genes of miR-204 and miR-302, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. hPESCs can develop into RPE-like cells, and can thus be additional promising sources of RPE cells in cell therapy. miR-204, miR-302s, and their targets are involved in regulating directed differentiation during the full course, thereby contributing to the search for a new method of improving differentiation efficiency using miRNAs.
