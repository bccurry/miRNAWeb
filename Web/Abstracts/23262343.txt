Relationship between genetic variant in pre-microRNA-146a and genetic predisposition to temporal lobe epilepsy: a case-control study. There is evidence that inflammatory mechanisms play a role in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding endogenous RNAs, which negatively regulate target gene expression, have shown different expression patterns in immune diseases. Recently, several miRNAs have been found to be differentially expressed in animal models of TLE. To understand the role of miRNAs in the molecular mechanisms of TLE, we sought to determine whether genetic variant rs2910164 in the pre-miR-146a gene could influence susceptibility to TLE in an Italian population sample. A cohort of 357 TLE patients and 543 healthy controls were genotyped for detection of this SNP using TaqMan Allelic Discrimination assays, on an Applied Biosystems PCR platform. Analysis of genotype or allelic frequencies between patients and controls showed no statistically significant differences (p=0.536 and p=0.361 respectively). Moreover, such variant did not influence the main clinical characteristics of TLE. In conclusion, our data suggest that the rs2910164 variant in the pre-miR-146a gene is unlikely to influence significantly the risk of developing TLE or its severity.
