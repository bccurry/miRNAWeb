MicroRNAs in platelet biogenesis and function: implications in vascular homeostasis and inflammation. Platelets are involved in vascular homeostasis and inflammation through interaction with circulating blood cells and vascular wall. MiRNAs are small, conserved and non-coding RNA molecules, which interact directly with specific mRNAs regions regulating gene expression. The purpose of this review is to gather all known platelet miRNAs and summarize their role in platelet biogenesis and function. Increasing evidence supports the role of miR-34a and miR-150 in megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. Although 284 miRNAs are described to be present in platelets, their role is mostly unknown. The most abundant miRNA in platelets is miR-223 followed by miR-126. The miR-96, miR-200b, miR- 495, miR-107 and miR-223 are critically involved in platelet reactivity, aggregation, secretion and adhesion. The presence of miRNAs known to regulate angiogenesis in platelets is also discussed. Furthermore, platelet-derived microvesicles and microparticles contain several miRNAs, which may facilitate the communication between platelets with other vascular cells, a mechanism that may play an important role in vascular homeostasis and inflammation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact roles of platelet miRNAs in platelet function and vascular biology.
