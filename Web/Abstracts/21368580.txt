MiR-203 controls proliferation, migration and invasive potential of prostate cancer cell lines. Prostate cancers show a slow progression from a local lesion (primary tumor) to a metastatic and hormone-resistant phenotype. After an initial step of hyperplasia, in a high percentage of cases a neoplastic transformation event occurs that, less frequently, is followed by epithelial to mesenchymal transition and invasion of healthy tissues (usually bones). MicroRNA-203 (miR-203) is a tumor suppressor microRNA often silenced in different malignancies. Here, we show that miR-203 is downregulated in clinical primary prostatic tumors compared to normal prostate tissue, and in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines compared to normal epithelial prostatic cells. Overexpression of miR-203 in brain or bone metastatic prostate cell lines (DU145 and PC3) is sufficient to induce a mesenchymal to epithelial transition with inhibition of cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness. We have identified CKAP2, LASP1, BIRC5, WASF1, ASAP1 and RUNX2 as new miR-203 direct target mRNAs involved in these events. Therefore, miR-203 could be a potentially new prognostic marker and therapeutic target in metastatic prostate cancer.
