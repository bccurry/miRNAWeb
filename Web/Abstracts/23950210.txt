MicroRNA-218 Inhibits Glioma Invasion, Migration, Proliferation and Cancer Stem-like Cell Self-renewal by Targeting the Polycomb Group Gene Bmi1. Malignant gliomas are the most common central nervous system tumors and the molecular mechanism driving their development and recurrence is still largely unknown, which greatly limits the successful treatment of this disease. Increasing evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in tumor progression by regulating gene expression. In particular, miR-218 has previously been shown to be downregulated in gliomas. Here, we demonstrate that upregulation of miR-218 dramatically reduced the migration, invasion and proliferation of glioma cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting analysis revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of Bmi1 was significantly decreased after overexpression of miR-218 in three human glioma cell lines we examined. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Bmi1 was a functional downstream target of miR-218 through the use of a luciferase assay and miR-218 regulated glioma cell migration and proliferation through Bmi1 downregulation. Bmi1 has previously been reported to regulate cell stemness. Therefore, we investigated the effects of miR-218 overexpression on the self-renewal capacity of glioma stem-like cells. The results indicated that miR-218 blocked glioma stem-like cell self-renewal. Finally, we show that miR-218 regulated a broad range of genes involved in glioma cell development by DNA microarray analysis, and also miR-218 regulate some pathway such as Wnt pathways to suppress glioma stemness, we discovered show that miR-218 negatively regulates genes that promote glioma development. Taken together, our findings reveal miR-218 as a tumor suppressor that prevents glioma cells migration, invasion, proliferation and cancer cell stemness.
