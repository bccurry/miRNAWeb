Standardized curcuminoid extract (Curcuma longa l.) decreases gene expression related to inflammation and interacts with associated microRNAs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The anti-inflammatory effects of curcuminoids have been extensively investigated. However, few studies investigate the mechanistic involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in their activity. The objective of this study was to examine the protective effects of standardized curcuminoid extract (SCE) in vascular inflammation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the potential involvement of miRNA-126 and miRNA-146a. Escherichia coli lipopolysacharides (LPS) were used to induce inflammation. LPS-challenge increased gene-expression of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and downstream genes IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6) up to 2.58-, 2.39-, and 3.73-fold, respectively, relative to DMSO-treated controls that were not challenged with LPS. LPS up-regulated TLR-4, IRAK-1, and TRAF-6 in SCE pretreated cells (5 mg L(-1)), only up to 0.69-, 1.28-, and 1.15-fold, respectively. miRNA-146a can be up-regulated by transcription nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) and acts as a negative feedback loop regulator involving IRAK-1 and TRAF-6 downregulation. In this study, the down-regulation of NF-B was accompanied by reduced miRNA-146a expression. LPS-challenge induced mRNA levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) up to 5.65- and 10.65-fold, respectively. SCE prevented this effect and increases of up to only 2.92- and 5.26-fold of DMSO-treated controls not challenged with LPS were observed. miRNA-126 regulates endothelial expression of VCAM-1, but was not inversely correlated to the expression of its target gene VCAM-1 upon SCE treatment; therefore, miRNA-126 does not appear to be involved in the down-regulation of VCAM-1. Overall, curcuminoids are confirmed to have anti-inflammatory properties in HUVEC; however, neither miRNA-146a nor miRNA-126 seem to be involved in the SCE-induced down-regulation of the NF-B-target genes IRAK-1, TRAF-6, and VCAM-1.
