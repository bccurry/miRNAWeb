MicroRNA-10 regulates the angiogenic behavior of zebrafish and human endothelial cells by promoting vascular endothelial growth factor signaling. Formation and remodeling of the vasculature during development and disease involve a highly conserved and precisely regulated network of attractants and repellants. Various signaling pathways control the behavior of endothelial cells, but their posttranscriptional dose titration by microRNAs is poorly understood. To identify microRNAs that regulate angiogenesis. We show that the highly conserved microRNA family encoding miR-10 regulates the behavior of endothelial cells during angiogenesis by positively titrating proangiogenic signaling. Knockdown of miR-10 led to premature truncation of intersegmental vessel growth in the trunk of zebrafish larvae, whereas overexpression of miR-10 promoted angiogenic behavior in zebrafish and cultured human umbilical venous endothelial cells. We found that miR-10 functions, in part, by directly regulating the level of fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1), a cell-surface protein that sequesters vascular endothelial growth factor, and its soluble splice variant sFLT1. The increase in FLT1/sFLT1 protein levels upon miR-10 knockdown in zebrafish and in human umbilical venous endothelial cells inhibited the angiogenic behavior of endothelial cells largely by antagonizing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 signaling. Our study provides insights into how FLT1 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 signaling is titrated in a microRNA-mediated manner and establishes miR-10 as a potential new target for the selective modulation of angiogenesis.
