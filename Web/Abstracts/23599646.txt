miRNA-338-3p suppresses cell growth of human colorectal carcinoma by targeting smoothened. To investigate the regulative effect of miRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p) on cell growth in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). The lentiviral vector pLV-THM-miR-338-3p and pLV-THM-miR-338-3p-inhibitor were constructed. The recombinant viral vector encoding the pre-miR-338-3p or miR-338-3p-inhibitor and the two packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G were cotransfected into human embryonic kidney 293T cells to package lentivirus. The supernatant containing the lentivirus particles was harvested to determine the viral titer, and this supernatant was then used to transduce CRC-derived cell line, SW-620. Flow cytometry was utilized for sorting the green fluorescent protein (GFP) cells to establish the SW-620 cell line stably expressing pre-miR-338-3p or miR-338-3p-inhibitor. Moreover, the expression of miR-338-3p was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting was used to detect the expression of the smoothened (SMO, the possible target of miR-338-3p) protein in SW-620 cells. Furthermore, the status of CRC cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing demonstrated that the lentiviral vector pLV-THM-miR-338-3p and pLV-THM-miR-338-3p-inhibitor were constructed successfully. GFP was expressed after the SW-620 cells were transduced by the lentivirus. Expression of miR-338-3p in SW-620 cells transduced with the lentivirus pLV-THM-miR-338-3p was significantly increased (relative expression 3.91  0.51 vs 2.36  0.44, P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-338-3p inhibited the expression of SMO protein in SW-620 cells, which showed obviously suppressed proliferation ability [cellular proliferation inhibition rate (CPIR) 61.9%  5.2% vs 41.6%  4.8%, P &lt; 0.01]. Expression of miR-338-3p in SW-620 cells transduced with the lentivirus pLV-THM-miR-338-3p-inhibitor was significantly decreased (relative expression 0.92  0.29 vs 2.36  0.44, P &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the downregulated expression of miR-338-3p caused upregulated expression of the SMO protein in SW-620 cells, which showed significantly enhanced proliferation ability (CPIR 19.2%  3.8% vs 41.6%  4.8%, P &lt; 0.01). However, anti-SMO-siRNA largely, but not completely, reversed the effects induced by blockage of miR-338-3p, suggesting that the regulative effect of miR-338-3p on CRC cell growth was indeed mediated by SMO. miR-338-3p could suppress CRC growth by inhibiting SMO protein expression.
