Discovery of prostate cancer biomarkers by microarray gene expression profiling. Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in males in the Western world. This review focuses on advances in biomarker discovery for prostate cancer by microarray profiling of mRNA and microRNA expression. Novel biomarkers are strongly needed to enable more accurate detection of prostate cancer, improve prediction of tumor aggressiveness and facilitate discovery of new therapeutic targets for tailored medicine. Promising molecular markers identified from gene expression profiling studies include AMACR, EZH2, TMPRSS2-ERG, miR-221 and miR-141, which are described in more detail. In addition, a compilation of prognostic gene expression signatures for prediction of prostate cancer patient outcome is provided, and their possible clinical utility is discussed. Furthermore, limitations in the application of microarray-based expression profiling for identification of prostate cancer biomarkers are addressed.
