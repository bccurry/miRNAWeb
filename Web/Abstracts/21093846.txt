Placental microRNA expression in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. The role of posttranscription regulation in preeclampsia is largely unknown. We investigated preeclampsia-related placental microRNA (miRNA) expression using microarray and confirmatory quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments. Placental expressions of characterized and novel miRNAs (1295 probes) were measured in samples collected from 20 preeclampsia cases and 20 controls. Differential expression was evaluated using Student t test and fold change analyses. In pathway analysis, we examined functions/functional relationships of targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. Eight miRNAs were differentially expressed (1 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated) among preeclampsia cases compared with controls. These included previously identified candidates (miR-210, miR-1, and a miRNA in the 14q32.31 cluster region) and others that are novel (miR-584 and miR-34c-5p). These miRNAs target genes that participate in organ/system development (cardiovascular and reproductive system), immunologic dysfunction, cell adhesion, cell cycle, and signaling. Expression of miRNAs that target genes in diverse pathophysiological processes is altered in the setting of preeclampsia.
