Regulation of erythroid differentiation by miR-376a and its targets. Lineage differentiation is a continuous process during which fated progenitor cells execute specific programs to produce mature counterparts. This lineage-restricted pathway can be controlled by particular regulators, which are usually exclusively expressed in certain cell types or at specific differentiation stages. Here we report that miR-376a participates in the regulation of the early stages of human erythropoiesis by targeting cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and Argonaute 2 (Ago2). Among various human leukemia cell lines, miR-376a was only detected in K562 cells which originated from a progenitor common to the erythroid and megakaryotic lineages. Enforced expression of miR-376a or silencing of CDK2 and Ago2 by RNAi inhibits erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Hematopoietic progenitor cells transduced with miR-376a showed a significant reduction of their erythroid clonogenic capacity. MiR-376a is relatively abundant in erythroid progenitor cells, where it reduces expression of CDK2 and maintains a low level of differentiation due to cell cycle arrest and decreased cell growth. Following erythroid induction, miR-376a is significantly down-regulated and CDK2 is released from miR-376a inhibition, thereby facilitating the escape of progenitor cells from the quiescent state into erythroid differentiation. Moreover, our results establish a functional link between miR-376a and Ago2, a key factor in miRNA biogenesis and silencing pathways with novel roles in human hematopoiesis.
