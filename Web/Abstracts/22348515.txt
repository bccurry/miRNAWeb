MiR-155 inhibits cell migration of human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (hCMPCs) via targeting of MMP-16. BACKGROUND: Undesired cell migration after targeted cell transplantation potentially limits beneficial effects for cardiac regeneration. MicroRNAs (miRs) are known to be involved in several cellular processes, including cell migration. Here, we attempt to reduce human cardiomyocyte progenitor cell (hCMPC) migration via increasing microRNA-155 (miR-155) levels, and investigate the underlying mechanism. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (hCMPCs) were transfected with pre-miR-155, anti-miR-155 or control-miR(ctrl-miR), followed by scratch- and transwell- assays. These functional assays displayed that miR-155 over-expression efficiently inhibited cell migration by 383.6% and 593.7%, respectively. Conditioned medium from miR-155 transfected cells was collected and zymography analysis showed a significant decrease in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. The predicted 3'-UTR of MMP-16, an activator of MMP-2 and -9, was cloned into the pMIR-REPORT vector and luciferase assays were performed. Introduction of miR-155 significantly reduced luciferase activity which could be abolished by co-transfection with anti-miR-155. By using MMP-16 siRNA to reduce MMP-16 levels or by using an MMP-16 blocking antibody, hCMPC migration could be blocked as well. CONCLUSION: By directly targeting MMP-16, miR-155 efficiently inhibits cell migration via a reduction in MMP-2 and -9 activities. These results might be used to maintain local targeting of hCMPC after local intramyocardial delivery.  2012 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine  2012 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
