Plasma miR-221 as a predictive biomarker for chemoresistance in breast cancer patients who previously received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly being used in breast cancer treatment. Research has revealed an elevated expression of miR-221 in adriamycinresistant MCF-7/ADR cells. This study aimed to explore the potential role of miR-221 as a biomarker for chemosensitivity in breast cancer patients who previously received NAC. The expression levels of circulating miR-221 in the plasma of 93 breast cancer patients who previously received NAC and in 32 healthy individuals were assessed. The correlations between miR-221 and clinicopathological features and chemosensitivity were also analysed. The expression level of miR-221 was significantly associated with hormone receptor (HR) status (p = 0.008). Patients with higher plasma miR-221 levels tended to be HR-negative. Patients with different miR-221 levels had significant differences in the overall response rate (p = 0.044) but not in the pathologic complete response rate (p = 0.477). Our results indicate that plasma miR-221 may be a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to NAC in breast cancer patients.
