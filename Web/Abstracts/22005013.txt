Molecular pathology of gastric cancer: research and practice. Recent advances in the understanding of molecular stomach carcinogenesis are reviewed. As to molecular events in individual mucin phenotypes of gastric cancer, the CDX2-Reg IV-SOX9 pathway is associated with the intestinal mucin phenotype, while OLFM4 and CLDN18 are novel markers for the gastric phenotype. microRNAs play an important role in epigenetic deregulation in gastric cancer. Many microRNAs are up-regulated and down-regulated, and some of these are associated with histological differentiation and cancer progression. Reduced miR-200 may participate in the genesis of diffuse type gastric cancer by reducing E-cadherin expression. Genetic polymorphism is a crucial endogenous cause and a fundamental factor of cancer risk. PSCA polymorphism alters the susceptibility to diffuse type gastric cancer through modulation of cell proliferation activity. Cancer stem cells possess the capacity for self-renewal and cause the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells. Cancer stem cells also show resistance to anti-tumor chemotherapy. Only a minor population of gastric cancer cells reveals the properties of cancer stem cells, and CD44 is one of the markers for gastric cancer stem cells. The origin of gastric cancer stem cells remains to be elucidated.
