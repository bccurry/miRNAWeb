Intronic miR-301 feedback regulates its host gene, ska2, in A549 cells by targeting MEOX2 to affect ERK/CREB pathways. miR-301 is localized in the first intron of ska2, whose function has not been clarified. Here, a new circuit model in which intronic miR-301 regulates the transcription and function of its host gene through a feedback mechanism has been described. Our results showed that blocking of miR-301 in A549 cells leads to a decrease in the expression of the host gene, ska2. Further analysis showed that miR-301 targets MEOX2 to affect the ERK/CREB pathway. CREB directly regulates the expression of the host gene, ska2. In addition, the inhibition of miR-301 or ska2 resulted in an increase of the mitotic index and a decrease in colony formation in soft agar, which may be related to lung tumorigenesis.
