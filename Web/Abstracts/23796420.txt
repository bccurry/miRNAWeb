miR-26a inhibits proliferation and motility in bladder cancer by targeting HMGA1. It is increasingly clear that microRNAs play a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Recently, emerging evidence suggested that miR-26a is aberrantly expressed in tumor tissues. In our study, frequent down-regulation of miR-26a was observed in 10 human bladder cancer tissues. Forced expression of miR-26a in the bladder cancer cell line T24 inhibited cell proliferation and impaired cell motility. High mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1), a gene that modulates cell cycle transition and cell motility, was verified as a novel target of miR-26a in bladder cancer. These findings indicate an important role for miR-26a in the molecular etiology of bladder cancer and implicate the potential application of miR-26a in bladder cancer therapy.
