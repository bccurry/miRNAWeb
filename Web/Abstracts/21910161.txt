Identification of altered MicroRNA expression in canine lymphoid cell lines and cases of B- and T-Cell lymphomas. Canine lymphoma is a common spontaneous tumor with many similarities to human lymphoma, and thus has potential to be an important animal model of lymphomagenesis. This study determined that microRNA (miRNA) expression in canine tumors can be assessed using a commercially available human cancer miRNA qPCR array. miRNA expression in six different canine lymphoid cell lines and in naturally occurring canine B- and T-cell lymphomas was compared using RNA harvested from normal canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and normal lymph nodes (LN) as controls. We found that false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing after quantile normalization controlled for variation across arrays and that they were the best methods for normalization and statistical analysis. Increases in miRNAs known to upregulate oncogenes (miR19a+b, miR17-5p) and decreased expression of miRNAs with tumor suppressor functions (miR-203, miR-218, and miR-181a) also seen in human lymphoid malignancies were observed. However, there were few similarities between canine groups. The results of this study indicate that the use of both PBMC and LN cells as controls provides different, but potentially equally important targets for further analysis. Our findings of miRNA dysregulation in canine lymphoid cell lines and clinical cases of lymphoma emphasize the potential of canine lymphoma as an important spontaneous, large animal model of human B- and T-cell lymphomas.
