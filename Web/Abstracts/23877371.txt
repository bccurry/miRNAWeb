Downregulation of microRNA-182 inhibits cell growth and invasion by targeting programmed cell death 4 in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer death worldwide. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), an important tumor suppressor, influences transcription and translation of multiple genes and modulates different signal transduction pathways. However, the upstream regulation of this gene is largely unknown. In our study, we found that microRNA-182 (miR-182) was upregulated, whereas PDCD4 was downregulated in lung cancer cell lines. We performed methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and colony formation assays to study the influence of miR-182 on proliferation of the lung cancer cell lines A549 and SPC-A-1. We also carried out Transwell and wound healing assays to investigate the effect of miR-182 on invasion and migration of A549 and SPC-A-1. Finally, using the luciferase reporter assay and restore assay, we demonstrated that PDCD4 is a direct target of miR-182. These results suggest that in lung adenocarcinoma cells, miR-182 plays an oncogenic role as a direct negative regulator of PDCD4.
