MicroRNA-107, an oncogene microRNA that regulates tumour invasion and metastasis by targeting DICER1 in gastric cancer. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that control expression of target genes. Previous studies showed that microRNA-107 (miR-107) is overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues compared with the matched normal tissues. However, it remains largely unclear as to how miR-107 exerts its function and modulates the malignant phenotypes of gastric cancer, because our understanding of miR-107 signalling pathways is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that miR-107 is frequently up-regulated in gastric cancers and its overexpression is significantly associated with gastric cancer metastasis. Furthermore, silencing the expression of miR-107 could inhibit gastric cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent investigation characterized DICER1 as a direct target of miR-107. Up-regulation of DICER1 resulted in a dramatic reduction of in vitro migration, invasion, in vivo liver metastasis of nude mice, which is similar to that occurs with the silencing of miR-107, indicating that DICER1 functions as a metastasis suppressor in gastric cancer. Furthermore, the restoration of DICER1 can inhibit miR-107-induced gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In conclusion, our results suggested that miR-107, an oncogene miRNA promoting gastric cancer metastasis through down-regulation of DICER1. Inhibition of miR-107 or restoration of DICER1 may represent a new potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer treatment.
