The expression and clinical significance of microRNA-1258 and heparanase in human breast cancer. To investigate the expression profile of miR-1258 and heparanase (HPSE) in breast cancer and to assess their clinicopathological significance. The expression levels of miR-1258 and HPSE were analyzed in normal, benign and malignant breast tissues. Their serum levels were evaluated in healthy women and in patients with benign and malignant breast disease. We studied the correlation between the expression of miR-1258 and HPSE and the clinical features presented by the patients. MiR-1258 was down-regulated and HPSE was up-regulated in breast cancer, with a significant inverse correlation. A reduced miR-1258 expression and an elevated HPSE expression were associated with the lymph node status, late clinical stages, a short overall survival and a short relapse-free survival. In frozen fresh tissue samples, the miR-1258 levels in breast cancer with lymph node metastasis were significantly lower than that of breast cancer without lymph node metastasis and benign disease (BD). In contrast, the HPSE levels in breast cancer with lymph node metastasis were the highest. In serum samples, the miR-1258 levels in metastatic breast cancer (M1) were lower than that of primary breast cancer (M0) and BD. However, serum HPSE levels of M1 patients were significantly higher than that of M0 patients and BD patients. MiR-1258 may play an important role in breast cancer development and progression by regulating the expression of HPSE, and they might be potential prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer.
