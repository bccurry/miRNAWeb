Circulating microRNA-26a: potential predictors and therapeutic targets for non-hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. The mechanisms of non-hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH), which may have different pathologies, mechanisms and genetic background from hypertensive ICH, are not clear. MicroRNAs are a new class of endogenous small RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Previous studies indicate that vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) function places important role in non-hypertensive ICH. MiRNA-26a, a pivotal regulator of VSMC function, is one of the cell-free miRNAs that could be detected in healthy humans. Therefore, we get the hypotheses that circulating miR-26a is a potential predictors and therapeutic targets for non-hypertensive ICH.
