MicroRNA-203 inhibits cell proliferation by repressing Np63 expression in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. This study was performed to investigate the effect of microRNA-203 (miR-203) and Np63 on cell proliferation and the functional connection between miR-203 and Np63 in ESCC. We employed 2 human ESCC cell lines, Eca109 and TE-1, as the model system. The effect of miR-203 and Np63 on cell proliferation was determined in cells transfected with miR-203 mimic and Np63 small interfering RNA (siRNA), respectively. The regulation of Np63 expression in ESCC cells by miR-203 was studied by luciferase reporter assay, RT-PCR and western blot analysis in cells transfected with miR-203. The effect of Np63 re-expression on miR-203 induced inhibition of cell proliferation was studied by cell proliferation assay in cells cotransfected with miR-203 and pcDNA-Np63 plasmid (without the 3'-UTR of Np63). We found that both miR-203 and Np63 siRNA signicantly inhibited cell proliferation in ESCC. MiR-203 could down-regulate endogenous Np63 expression at the posttranscriptional level. Moreover, re-expression of Np63 in cells transfected with miR-203 significantly attenuated the miR-203 induced inhibition of cell proliferation. Our data implied that miR-203 could inhibit cell proliferation in human ESCC through Np63-mediated signal pathway. Therefore, we propose that miR-203 might be used as a therapeutic agent for human ESCC.
