MicroRNAs regulate dendritic cell differentiation and function. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of cellular regulators that modulate gene expression and thereby influence cell fate and function. In the immune system, miRNAs act at checkpoints during hematopoietic development and cell subset differentiation, they modulate effector cell function, and they are implicated in the maintenance of homeostasis. Dendritic cells (DCs), the professional APCs involved in the coordination of adaptive immune responses, are also regulated by miRNAs. Some DC-relevant miRNAs, including miR-155 and miR-146a, are shared with other immune cells, whereas others have been newly identified. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of where miRNAs are active during DC development from myeloid precursors and differentiation into specialized subsets, and which miRNAs play roles in DC function.
