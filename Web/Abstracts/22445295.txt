MicroRNA regulation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice and marmosets resembles regulation in human multiple sclerosis lesions. Here we demonstrate that miRNA regulation in marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and C57/BL6 mouse EAE lesions largely resembles miRNA regulation in active human MS lesions. Detailed quantitative PCR analyses of the most up- and downregulated miRNAs of active human MS lesions in dissected lesions from marmoset EAE brains and inflamed spinal cords of EAE mice revealed that the conserved and highly regulated miRNAs, miRNA-155, miRNA-142-3p, miRNA-146a, miRNA-146b and miRNA-21, turned out to be similarly upregulated in marmoset and mouse EAE lesions.
