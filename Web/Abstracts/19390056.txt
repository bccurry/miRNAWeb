Interleukin-6 modulates the expression of the bone morphogenic protein receptor type II through a novel STAT3-microRNA cluster 17/92 pathway. Dysregulated expression of bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2) is a pathogenetic hallmark of pulmonary hypertension. Downregulation of BMPR2 protein but not mRNA has been observed in multiple animal models mimicking the disease, indicating a posttranscriptional mechanism of regulation. Because microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression mainly through inhibition of target gene translation, we hypothesized that miRNAs may play a role in the modulation of BMPR2. Performing a computational algorithm on the BMPR2 gene, several miRNAs encoded by the miRNA cluster 17/92 (miR-17/92) were retrieved as potential regulators. Ectopic overexpression of miR-17/92 resulted in a strong reduction of the BMPR2 protein, and a reporter gene system showed that BMPR2 is directly targeted by miR-17-5p and miR-20a. By stimulation experiments, we found that the miR-17/92 cluster is modulated by interleukin (IL)-6, a cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. Because IL-6 signaling is mainly mediated by STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), the expression of STAT3 was knocked down by small interfering RNA, which abolished the IL-6-mediated expression of miR-17/92. Consistent with these data, we found a highly conserved STAT3-binding site in the promoter region of the miR-17/92 gene (C13orf25). Promoter studies confirmed that IL-6 enhances transcription of C13orf25 through this distinct region. Finally, we showed that persistent activation of STAT3 leads to repressed protein expression of BMPR2. Taken together, we describe here a novel STAT3-miR-17/92-BMPR2 pathway, thus providing a mechanistic explanation for the loss of BMPR2 in the development of pulmonary hypertension.
