MicroRNA-330 is an oncogenic factor in glioblastoma cells by regulating SH3GL2 gene. MicroRNAs have recently emerged as key regulators of cancers. This study was therefore conducted to investigate the role of miR-330 in biological behaviors of human glioblastoma U87 and U251 cell lines and its molecular mechanism. SH3GL2 gene was identified as the target of miR-330. MiR-330 overexpression was established by transfecting miR-330 precursor into U87 and U251 cells, and its effects on proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle and apoptosis were studied. Overexpression of miR-330 can enhance cellular proliferation, promote migration and invasion, activate cell cycle and also inhibit apoptosis in U87 and U251 cells. Collectively, these above-mentioned results suggest that miRNA-330 plays an oncogenic role in human glioblastoma by regulating SH3GL2 gene and might be a new therapeutic target of human glioblastoma.
