Highly increased maspin expression corresponds with up-regulation of miR-21 in endometrial cancer: a preliminary report. Maspin and programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4) are tumor suppressor genes, and miR-21 is overexpressed in many solid tumors and was proven to negatively regulate a number of tumor suppressor genes including maspin and Pdcd4.The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of maspin, Pdcd4, and miR-21 and their interrelations with clinicopathologic features in endometrial cancer using a quantitative approach. Maspin, Pdcd4, and miR-21 expressions were evaluated by a real-time polymerase chain reaction in 20 endometrial cancer and 10 normal endometrium samples. Maspin showed a significantly increased expression in endometrial cancer samples compared with the control group and was up-regulated by a mean factor of 46.54 (SE range, 2.367-1160.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.515-15001, P &lt; 0.0001). Expression of miR-21 was found significantly up-regulated in the sample group in comparison to control group by a mean factor of 2.312 (SE range, 0.741-7.778; 95% confidence interval 0.191-15.0, P = 0.028). No significant differences were present in the expression level of Pdcd4 between endometrial cancer and control groups. Comparison between IA and more advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages of endometrial cancer in regard to expression levels of maspin, Pdcd4, and miR-21 did not reveal any significant differences. Similarly, no differences were encountered when histopathologic grading, myometrial invasion, age, body mass index, and parity were taken into consideration. Association between increased maspin expression and up-regulation of miR-21 in endometrial cancer suggests distinct and tissue-specific relationships of the 2 molecules in this type of malignancy and requires further studies that would reveal its clinical relevance.
