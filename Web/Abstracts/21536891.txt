Regulation of angiogenesis and choroidal neovascularization by members of microRNA-23~27~24 clusters. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate complex physiological and pathological processes by repressing expression of multiple components of cellular regulatory networks. Here we demonstrate that miRNAs encoded by the miR-232724 gene clusters are enriched in endothelial cells and highly vascularized tissues. Inhibition of miR-23 and miR-27 function by locked nucleic acid-modified anti-miRNAs represses angiogenesis in vitro and postnatal retinal vascular development in vivo. Moreover, miR-23 and miR-27 are required for pathological angiogenesis in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization mouse model. MiR-23 and miR-27 enhance angiogenesis by promoting angiogenic signaling through targeting Sprouty2 and Sema6A proteins, which exert antiangiogenic activity. Manipulating miR-23/27 levels may have important therapeutic implications in neovascular age-related macular degeneration and other vascular disorders.
