Rapamycin inhibits human glioma cell proliferation through down-regulating mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and up-regulating microRNA-143. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that rapamycin regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis and glycolysis in human glioma cells and to investigate the underlying mechanism. Human malignant glioma cell line U251 cells were treated with 100 mM rapamycin for 6, 12 and 24 h. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assayed by methylthiazol tetrazolium assay and flow cytometric analyses. RNA and protein expression levels were then measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. The administration of rapamycin inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of U251 cells. Prolonged treatment with rapamycin gradually decreased the mammalian target of rapamycin signalling in U251 cells. Moreover, our data showed rapamycin up-regulated miR-143 and down-regulated hexokinase 2-a key enzyme in glycolysis-in the glioma U251 cells. Collectively, our data suggests a new anti-tumour role of rapamycin in gliomas and indicates that rapamycin-mediated glioma cell proliferation might be through inhibiting the mammalian target of the rapamycin pathway and up-regulating tumour suppressing miR-143. These data suggest a promising, novel rapamycin- and miR-143-based therapy to treat malignant glioma.
