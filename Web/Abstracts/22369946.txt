Identification of miR-508-3p and miR-509-3p that are associated with cell invasion and migration and involved in the apoptosis of renal cell carcinoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as powerful regulators of multiple processes linked to human cancer, including cell apoptosis, proliferation and migration, suggesting that the regulation of miRNA function could play a critical role in cancer progression. Recent studies have found that human serum/plasma contains stably expressed miRNAs. If they prove indicative of disease states, miRNAs measured from peripheral blood samples may be a source for routine clinical detection of cancer. Our studies showed that both miR-508-3p and miR-509-3p were down-regulated in renal cancer tissues. The level of miR-508-3p but not miR-509-3p in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patient plasma demonstrated significant differences from that in control plasma. In addition, the overexpression of miR-508-3p and miR-509-3p suppressed the proliferation of RCC cells (786-0), induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell migration in vitro. Our data demonstrated that miR-508-3p and miR-509-3p played an important role as tumor suppressor genes during tumor formation and that they may serve as novel diagnostic markers for RCC.
