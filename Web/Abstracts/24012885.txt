Angiogenesis, mediated by miR-21, is involved arsenite-induced carcinogenesis. Evidence for arsenite-induced lung cancer in humans is strong, but the molecular mechanisms by which arsenite causes cancer remain to be established. Angiogenesis is a fundamental characteristic of cancer and is necessary in its multi-step progression. In this investigation, the mechanism for arsenite-induced angiogenesis was evaluated. Tumors formed from human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells transformed by arsenite developed new blood vessels, which were prevented by the knockdown of miR-21, and cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to arsenite developed endothelial tubes, a characteristic of angiogenesis. Also found in transformed HBE cells were up-regulation of a microRNA, miR-21, and increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes angiogenesis. Down-regulation of miR-21 in these cells inhibited the arsenite-induced increases of VEGF levels. Thus, we conclude that arsenite induces tumor angiogenesis through processes mediated by miR-21.
