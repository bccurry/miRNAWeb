Chemical Synthesis of LNA-mCTP and its application for MicroRNA detection. Locked nucleic acids (LNA) are being applied in hybridization studies, but current locked nucleotides cannot be transcribed into RNA probes. Here, the authors report the use of a new synthetic locked nucleotide, locMeCytidine-5'-triphosphate (LNA-mCTP), for hybridization study. This synthetic LNA-mCTP can be transcribed into a short ( approximately 30-nt) RNA probe. Dot blot hybridization on nylon membrane suggested that the short (33)P-LNA RNA probes had strong binding affinity to target oligonucleotides and its detection sensitivity was approximately approximately 1000 miRNAs in a 20- to 30-mum (diameter) dot area. On tissue sections, the differential expression pattern of mir-124 within different tissue regions revealed by short (33)P- LNA RNA probes correlated well to that analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, the specific cellular distribution of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide mRNAs in the mouse brain was the same using a 30-nt (33)P-LNA RNA probe and a 1.5-kb (33)P-RNA probe. These results suggested the high hybridization specificity of the small LNA-RNA probes to target small RNAs. Finally, the authors applied (33)P-LNA probes to detect miRNA let-7C expression in human cancer tissues. Let-7C was clearly present in lung, prostate, and colon cancers but undetectable in ovary and thyroid cancer samples. These results suggested that this miRNA detection method provides an alternative tool to study the cellular distribution of miRNAs in tissues.
