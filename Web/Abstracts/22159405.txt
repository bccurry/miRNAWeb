microRNA-1301-mediated inhibition of tumorigenesis. The relatively recent discovery of microRNAs has added a completely new dimension to the study of the regulation of tumor cells, but how they control cell behavior remains largely elusive. HepG2 cells were assigned to the miR-1301 group and the control group. RT-PCR, Western blotting, wound healing, the Transwell chamber migration and MTT assays, and apoptosis detection assays were used to analyze cell behavior of HepG2 cells after miR-1301 mimic transfection. Our study showed that miR-1301 was downregulated in HepG2 cells, and that miR-1301 inhibited migration and invasion of HepG2 cells and promoted cellular apoptosis after transfection with miR-1301 mimics. In addition, p53 mRNA and p53 protein expression was upregulated, and Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNA and protein expression was downregulated in the miR-1301 group. These results indicate that miR-1301 may be an inhibitor of tumorigenesis in HepG2 cells.
