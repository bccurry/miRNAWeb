miR-10 in development and cancer. The microRNA (miRNA) miR-10 family has attracted attention because of its conservation and the position of the miR-10 genes within the Hox clusters of developmental regulators. In several species, miR-10 is coexpressed with a set of Hox genes and has been found to regulate the translation of Hox transcripts. In addition, members of the miR-10 family are de-regulated in several cancer forms. Aside from acting in translational repression, miR-10 was recently found to bind a group of transcripts containing a terminal oligo-pyrimidine (TOP) motif and to induce their translation, thereby adding a new function to the miRNA repertoire.
