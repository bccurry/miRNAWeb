High expression of microRNA127 is involved in cell cycle arrest in MC3 mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells. microRNAs (miRs) are small endogenous noncoding RNAs and are associated with the pathogenesis of a number of types of human cancer. However, miR1273p in mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) has not been studied. The present study aimed to analyze the importance of miR1273p in MC3 human MEC cells. Analyses of the growth inhibitory effect and the associated mechanism of miR1273p were performed using 3(4,5dimethylthiazol20yl)(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)2(4sulphophenyl)2Htetrazolium assay, flow cytometry, 4'6diamidino2phenylindole staining, anchorageindependent cell transformation assay and western blot analysis. Transfection of exogenous miR1273p into MC3 cells inhibited cell viability and led to G1/S cell cycle arrest. In addition, miR1273p also decreased neoplastic cell transformation in TPAinduced JB6 mouse epidermal and MC3 cells. In addition, miR1273p decreased specificity protein 1 (Sp1) expression and increased p21 and p27 expression which are Sp1dependent cell cyclerelated proteins. However, miR1273p did not induce apoptosis or affect expression levels of myeloid cell leukemia1 or survivin. miR1273p induced G1/S cell cycle arrest and increased p21 and p27 expression via modulation of Sp1. Therefore, miR1273p may be a therapeutic target for human MEC.
