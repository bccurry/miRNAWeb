MicroRNA-21 in Scleroderma Fibrosis and its Function in TGF-- Regulated Fibrosis-Related Genes Expression. Uncontrolled fibrosis in multiple organs is the main cause of death in systemic sclerosis (SSc), and transforming growth factor- (TGF-) activation plays a fundamental role in the process. Our previous study demonstrated that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated in SSc fibroblasts. Here, we found that TGF- regulated the expression of miR-21 and fibrosis-related genes, and decreased Smad7 expression. Over-expression of miR-21 in fibroblasts decreased the levels of Smad7, whereas knockdown of miR-21 increased its expression. Further study using a reporter gene assay demonstrated Smad7 was a direct target of miR-21. Similar to human SSc, the expression of miR-21 increased in the bleomycin induced skin fibrosis. Inhibition of fibrosis by treatment with anti-fibrosis drug bortezomib restored the levels of miR-21 and Smad7. MiR-21 may function in an amplifying circuit to enhance TGF- signaling events in SSc fibrosis, and suggesting that miR-21 may act as a potential therapeutic target.
