Spherical cell shape of FLC-4 cell, a human hepatoma cell, enhances hepatocyte-specific function and suppresses tumor phenotype through the integration of mRNA-microRNA interaction. The induction mechanism of HNF-4 by spherical cell shape in human hepatoma cells, FLC-4, was investigated. To get insight into the induction mechanism of HNF-4 in three-dimensional FLC-4 cells, mRNA microarray analysis was performed. The gene expression related to drug metabolism and nuclear receptors, such as LXR, was elevated in spherical FLC-4 cells. We found the first time that the expressions of genes related to malignancy of hepatoma cells, such as HIF-1, c-Myc and VEGFC, were downregulated by spherical cell shape. Network analysis revealed that HNF-4 would elicit both the enhancement of hepatocyte-specific gene expression and suppression of malignancy. Since HNF-4 gene expression was known to be regulated by microRNA, we inferred that spherical cell shape would induce HNF-4 gene expression through microRNA. To investigate the possibility of such a mechanism, mRNA-microRNA interactions were examined using microRNA microarray and bioinformatics analysis. The level of miR-24, a microRNA targeting HNF-4, was reduced in spherical FLC-4 cells. On the other hand, spherical cell shape-induced miR-194 and miR-320c would directly downregulate SLC7A5 and E2F1 gene expression, respectively, which are both related to malignancy. Our study suggested that spherical cell shape would induce HNF-4 gene expression and consequent enhancement hepatocyte-specific functions. Spherical cell shape itself would suppress malignancy in FLC-4 cells through microRNA, such as miR-194 and miR-320c.
