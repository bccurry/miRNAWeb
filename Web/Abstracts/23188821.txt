Identification of microRNA-98 as a therapeutic target inhibiting prostate cancer growth and a biomarker induced by vitamin D. The anti-tumor effect of vitamin D has been well recognized but its translational application is hindered by side effects induced by supra-physiological concentration of vitamin D required for cancer treatment. Thus, exploring the vitamin D tumor suppressive functional mechanism can facilitate improvement of its clinical application. We screened miRNA profiles in response to vitamin D and found that a tumor suppressive miRNA, miR-98, is transcriptionally induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-VD) in LNCaP. Mechanistic dissection revealed that 1,25-VD-induced miR-98 is mediated through both a direct mechanism, enhancing the VDR binding response element in the promoter region of miR-98, and an indirect mechanism, down-regulating LIN-28 expression. Knockdown of miR-98 led to a reduction of 1,25-VD anti-growth effect and overexpression of miR-98 suppressed the LNCaP cells growth via inducing G2/M arrest. And CCNJ, a protein controlling cell mitosis, is down-regulated by miR-98 via targeting 3'-untranslated region of CCNJ. Interestingly, miR-98 levels in blood are increased upon 1,25-VD treatment in mice suggesting the biomarker potential of miR-98 in predicting 1,25-VD response. Together, the finding that growth inhibitive miR-98 is induced by 1,25-VD provides a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer and a potential biomarker for 1,25-VD anti-tumor action.
