Novel regulation of nuclear factor-YB by miR-485-3p affects the expression of DNA topoisomerase II and drug responsiveness. Nuclear factor (NF)-YB, a subunit of the transcription factor nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) complex, binds and activates CCAAT-containing promoters. Our previous work suggested that NF-YB may be a mediator of topoisomerase II (Top2), working through the Top2 promoter. DNA topoisomerase II (Top2) is an essential nuclear enzyme and the primary target for several clinically important anticancer drugs. Our teniposide-resistant human lymphoblastic leukemia CEM cells (CEM/VM-1-5) express reduced Top2 protein compared with parental CEM cells. To study the regulation of Top2 during the development of drug resistance, we found that NF-YB protein expression is increased in CEM/VM-1-5 cells compared with parental CEM cells. This further suggests that increased NF-YB may be a negative regulator of Top2 in CEM/VM-1-5 cells. We asked what causes the up-regulation of NF-YB in CEM/VM-1-5 cells. We found by microRNA profiling that hsa-miR-485-3p is lower in CEM/VM-1-5 cells compared with CEM cells. MicroRNA target prediction programs revealed that the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of NF-YB harbors a putative hsa-miR-485-3p binding site. We thus hypothesized that hsa-miR-485-3p mediates drug responsiveness by decreasing NF-YB expression, which in turn negatively regulates Top2 expression. To test this, we overexpressed miR-485-3p in CEM/VM-1-5 cells and found that this led to reduced expression of NF-YB, a corresponding up-regulation of Top2, and increased sensitivity to the Top2 inhibitors. Results in CEM cells were replicated in drug-sensitive and -resistant human rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 cells, suggesting that our findings represent a general phenomenon. Ours is the first study to show that miR-485-3p mediates Top2 down-regulation in part by altered regulation of NF-YB.
