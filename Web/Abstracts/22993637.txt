Association between common genetic variants in pre-microRNAs and the clinicopathological characteristics and survival of gastric cancer patients. Common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be associated with susceptibility to several types of human cancer. We evaluated the association between three SNPs (rs11614913, rs2910164 and rs3746444) in pre-miRNAs (miR-196a2, miR-146a and miR-499) and various clinicopathological characteristics, including CpG island hypermethylation (CIHM) status and overall survival in gastric cancer (GC) patients. rs11614913 (T&gt;C), rs2910164 (C&gt;G) and rs3746444 (A&gt;G) SNPs were genotyped in 127 GC patients. CIHM of p14, p16, DAP-kinase and CDH1 genes was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in the cancer tissues. A significant marginal association was found between the rs11614913 CC genotype and polypoid or elevated type morphology in early-stage GC (OR=6.29, 95% CI 1.18-33.47, p=0.03). The rs2910164 CC and CG genotypes were associated with increased susceptibility to CIHM of DAP-kinase (CC+CG, OR=5.48, 95% CI 1.30-23.10, p=0.02; CC, OR=6.93, 95% CI 1.37-35.02, p=0.02; CG, OR=4.24, 95% CI 0.87-20.78, p=0.07). The 11614913 TT and TC genotypes were associated with a higher number of CIHM (no. of CIHM 0-1 vs. 2-4; TT+TC, OR=3.67, 95% CI 0.98-13.72, p=0.05; TC, OR=4.08, 95% CI 1.04-15.97, p=0.04). When the subjects were divided according to age group, the combined rs11614913 TT+TC genotype tended to be associated with worse overall survival than the CC genotype in patients younger than 65 years of age (p=0.05). The combined rs2910164 CG+GG genotype also tended to be associated with worse overall survival than the CC genotype in the same age group (p=0.09). It appears that rs11614913 and rs2910164 SNPs in pre-miRNAs (miR-196a2 and miR-146a) affect the clinicopathological characteristics of GC, including its morphological appearance, CIHM status and overall survival.
