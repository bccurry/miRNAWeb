MicroRNA-193b modulates proliferation, migration, and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer cells. MicroRNAs have been reported to be closely related to the development of human lung cancers. However, the functions of microRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain largely undefined. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-193b (miR-193b) in NSCLC. Our data showed that miR-193b was markedly down-regulated in NSCLC cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. The NSCLC cell line (A549) transfected with the miR-193b exhibited significantly decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion capacities when compared with the control cells. In contrast, inhibition of miR-193b increased the proliferation, migration, and invasion of A549 cells. Moreover, miR-193b repressed the expressions of cyclin D1 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator in A549 cells. These data suggest that miR-193b is a tumor suppressor in NSCLC.
