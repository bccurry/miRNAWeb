Human CYP2C8 is Post-transcriptionally Regulated by MicroRNAs 103 and 107 in Human Liver. The CYP2C genes are extensively regulated at the transcriptional stage. The present study shows for the first time that CYP2Cs are also regulated post-transcriptionally by microRNAs (miRNAs). Using an on-line search engine, we found potential recognition sites for miRNAs (MRE's) in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the CYP2C mRNAs. Among these were a MRE for miR-103/107 in the 3'- UTR of human CYP2C8. Moreover, CYP2C8 protein as measured by immunoblot analysis did not correlate with CYP2C8 mRNA measured by qPCR in human liver samples. Instead, the translational efficiency of CYP2C8 (protein/mRNA) was inversely correlated with the expression of miR-103 and miR-107. When three copies of the putative MREs from CYP2C8 were inserted downstream of a luciferase expression reporter, transfection with precursors for miR-103 or miR-107 into primary hepatocytes decreased luciferase activity while transfection with antisense oligonucleotides (AsOs) for miR-103/107 increased luciferase activity. As expected, there was no effect of the precursors or AsOs when three copies of the putative MRE's were in the reverse orientation. Moreover, when precursors for miR-103/107 were transfected into primary human hepatocytes, CYP2C8 protein was decreased, while AsOs increased the CYP2C8 protein levels. Neither precursors nor AsOs affected CYP2C8 mRNA, indicating the effect was post-transcriptional. Putative MRE motifs were also found in the 3'-UTR of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, suggesting the same miRNAs could regulate translation of other members of CYP2C family albeit to a lesser degree than CYP2C8. These results clearly show that CYP2Cs are regulated post-transcriptionally by miR-103 and miR-107.
