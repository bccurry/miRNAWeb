MiR-125 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. MiR-125 is a highly conserved microRNA throughout many different species from nematode to humans. In humans, there are three homologs (hsa-miR-125b-1, hsa-miR-125b-2 and hsa-miR-125a). Here we review a recent research on the role of miR-125 in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. Its high expression in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) enhances self-renewal and survival. Its expression in specific subtypes of myeloid and lymphoid leukemias provides resistance to apoptosis and blocks further differentiation. A direct oncogenic role in the hematopoietic system has recently been demonstrated by several mouse models. Targets of miR-125b include key proteins regulating apoptosis, innate immunity, inflammation and hematopoietic differentiation.Leukemia advance online publication, 24 April 2012; doi:10.1038/leu.2012.90.
