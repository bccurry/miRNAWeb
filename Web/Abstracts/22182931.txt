Association between the rs2910164 polymorphism in pre-mir-146a and oral carcinoma progression. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by RNA interference. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent malignancy worldwide. miR-146a has been reported to regulate Toll-like receptors and cytokine signaling, which are both crucial for inflammation and oncogenesis. This study identifies that areca nut extract, TNF and TGF up-regulates miR-146a in OSCC cells. The increased expression of miR-146a enhanced the oncogenicity of OSCC cells. In addition, a G to C polymorphism (rs2910164), which is located in the pre-miR-146a and has been associated with functional alterations in miR-146a, was significantly more prevalent among OSCC patients having more advanced nodal involvement. Our analysis also suggested a higher miR-146a expression in OSCC tissues of patients carrying C polymorphism. The present study concluded a higher prevalence of the pre-mir-146a C-variant was associated with OSCC progression in patients with this disease.
