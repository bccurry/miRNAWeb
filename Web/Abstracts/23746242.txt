[Construction and expression of recombinant lentivirus encoding miR-203 and its inhibitory effect on proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells]. Objective To construct a recombinant lentivirus harboring human-derived microRNA-203 (miR-203), and investigate its biological effect on proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC-12). Methods The precursor miR-203 DNA fragment was obtained by PCR and inserted into pLenti-6.3 lentivirus vector, and then was stably transfected into HUVEC-12 cells (HUVEC-Lv-miR-203). Overexpression of exogenous pre-miR-203 was determined using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Subsequently, to investigate its effects on proliferation and migration of HUVEC-12 cells, MTT assay and wound healing assay were respectively performed. Results We successfully constructed a lentivirus-based delivery system to stably express exogenous pre-miR-203 in HUVEC-12 cells. MTT assay and wound healing assay showed that miR-203 could significantly suppress cell proliferation and migration of HUVEC-12. Conclusion MiR-203 has the inhibitory effect on the proliferation and migration of HUVEC-12 cells.
