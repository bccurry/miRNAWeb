microRNA-1/133a and microRNA-206/133b clusters: dysregulation and functional roles in human cancers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous short non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by repressing translation or cleaving RNA transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. A growing body of evidence suggests that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in many human cancers and that they play significant roles in the initiation, development and metastasis of human cancers. Genome-wide miRNA expression signatures provide information on the aberrant expression of miRNAs in cancers rapidly and precisely. Recently, studies from our group and others revealed that microRNA-1 (miR-1), microRNA-133a (miR-133a), microRNA-133b(miR-133b) and microRNA-206 (miR-206) are frequently downregulated in various types of cancers. Interestingly, miR-1-1/miR-133a-2,miR-1-2/miR-133a-1, and miR-206/miR-133b form clusters in three different chromosomal regions of the human genome - 20q13.33, 18q11.2 and 6p12.1, respectively. Here we review highlights of recent findings on the aberrant expression and functional significance ofthe miR-1/miR-133a and miR-206/miR-133b clusters in human cancers.
