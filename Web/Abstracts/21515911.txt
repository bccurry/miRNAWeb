MicroRNA-155 is involved in the remodelling of human-trophoblast-derived HTR-8/SVneo cells induced by lipopolysaccharides. A low dose injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) may induce pre-eclampsia-like symptoms in rats, and microRNA-155 (miR-155) is elevated in the placentas of patients with pre-eclampsia. Our goal was to investigate the association of miR-155 with pre-eclampsia and the pathways involved using human-trophoblast-derived cell line (HTR-8/SVneo) stimulated with LPS. We measured miR-155 in HTR-8/SVneo cells treated with LPS (25-800 ng/ml) using real-time PCR. Western blotting was used to study transcription factor activated protein 1 (AP-1) (JunB and FosB subunits) and nuclear factor (NF)-B p65 in the HTR-8/SVneo cells and placentas from patients with pre-eclampsia. DNA precipitation assays and luciferase reporter analysis were used to evaluate the regulation of miR-155 by AP-1 and NF-B. Cell migration was determined by scratch assay. Syncytialization of HTR-8/SVneo cells was analysed following transfection with miR-155. miR-155 was increased together with AP-1 and NF-B in HTR-8/SVneo cells incubated with low dose of LPS (100 ng/ml; P &lt; 0.05 versus baseline). Both JunB/FosB and p65 were increased in placenta from women with severe pre-eclampsia versus a normal pregnancy, with elevated expression of miR-155 (P &lt; 0.05). For specific DNA-binding sites upstream of BIC/miR-155 gene promoter, the AP-1 site was more important than the NF-B site for increasing miR-155 in HTR-8/SVneo cells. The cells with enforced expression of miR-155 showed a reduced ability to migrate (P &lt; 0.05) and an increased number of syncytiotrophoblast-like multinuclear cells (P &lt; 0.05). LPS may induce remodelling of the human-trophoblast-derived HTR-8/SVneo cells by increasing miR-155, acting in part through the AP-1 and NF-B pathways.
