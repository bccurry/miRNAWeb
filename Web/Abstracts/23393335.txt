MicroRNA 181a influences the expression of HMGB1 and CD4 in acute Leukemias. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRs) has been linked to several types of cancer. In the present study, we investigated the expression of miR-181a in different leukemia cell lines and healthy hematopoietic cells, as well as its influence on cell proliferation, metabolic activity and potential targets. Expression of miR-181a differed between various leukemia cell lines and mature blood cells. Inhibition of miR 181a expression in T- and B-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cells revealed an influence on the potential targets High-Mobility-Group-Protein B1 (HMGB1) and Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4). Overexpression of miR-181a in AML cells led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation and metabolic activity. The present data indicate a possible role of this specific miRNA in immunogenicity.
