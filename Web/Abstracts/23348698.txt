miR-206 inhibits gastric cancer proliferation in part by repressing cyclinD2. In this study, we detected miR-206 expression in gastric cancer (GC) and further investigated its effects on GC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. miR-206 expression was found to be significantly decreased in 30 GC samples and GC cell lines by real time-PCR. Restoration of miR-206 reduced cell growth and colony forming ability in GC cells with G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Further studies demonstrated that miR-206 could suppress GC cells proliferation at least partially through targeting the cyclinD2 (CCND2). Therefore, we provided evidence that miR-206 was a potential tumor suppressor and may be used as a therapeutic target for gastric cancer.
