ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1: identification and regulation by estrogen in chickens. The ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (ERRFI1) is a scaffolding adaptor protein, that plays a pivotal role in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cell signaling cascade as a negative regulator affecting many important physiological processes. It was recently reported that ERRFI1 is a critical regulator of the response of the endometrium to estrogen regulation of tissue homeostasis in mice. But, very little is known about ERRF11 and hormonal regulation of the ERRFI1 gene in chickens. Therefore, in the present study, ERRFI1 gene was cloned and its differential expression profile analyzed at different embryonic stages, in various adult organs, and in oviducts from estrogen-treated chickens. Chicken ERRFI1 has an open-reading frame of 2848 nucleotides that encode for a protein of 465 amino acids that has considerable homology to mammalian ERRFI1 proteins (&gt;62% identity). Importantly, ERRFI1 mRNA is abundantly distributed in various organs from chickens. We then determined that DES (diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen) induced ERRFI1 mRNA and protein predominantly in luminal and glandular epithelial cells of the oviduct. Further, we determined whether microRNAs, specifically miR-200b, miR-429 and miR-1639, influence ERRFI1 expression via its 3'UTR and found that it does not directly target the 3'UTR of ERRFI1 mRNA. Therefore, it is unlikely that post-transcriptional regulation influences ERRFI1 expression in the chicken oviduct. In conclusion, our results indicate that ERRFI1 is a novel estrogen-stimulated gene expressed in epithelial cells of the chicken oviduct that likely plays an important role in oviduct growth and differentiation during early development of the chicken.
