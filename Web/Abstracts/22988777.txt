[Mapping of the 3' end for artificial human microRNA]. The 3' end was exactly mapped for has-mir-30a-like artificial human microRNAs that specifically recognize the mRNA of the aml1/eto fusion oncogene. The results indicated that the intracellular microRNA pool was heterogeneous in linear size relative to the 3' end, which is necessary to consider in designing and using artificial microRNAs specific for mRNAs of other genes.
