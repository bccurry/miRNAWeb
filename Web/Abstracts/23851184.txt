Diallyl disulfide suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in human gastric cancer through Wnt-1 signaling pathway by up-regulation of miR-200b and miR-22. The purpose of this study was to identify a mechanism related to miRNA pathway which plays a role in the anti-tumor effects of Diallyl disulfide. Alterations in miRNA expression were observed in Diallyl disulfide-treated MGC-803 cells, including up-regulation of miR-200b and miR-22 expression. Furthermore, Wnt-1 was identified as a target of both miR-200b and miR-22. MiR-200b and miR-22 not only synergistically inhibited gastric cancer growth, but also enhanced the antitumor effect of Diallyl disulfide both in vitro and in vivo. It indicated that miR-200b and miR-22 may serve as potential gene therapy and enhance Diallyl disulfide antitumor effects.
