miR-146a and miR-150 promote the differentiation of CD133(+) cells into T-lymphoid lineage. MicroRNAs control the genes involved in hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) survival, proliferation and differentiation. The over-expression of miR-146 and miR-150 has been reported during differentiation of HSCs into T-lymphoid lineage. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the effect of their over-expression on CD133(+) cells differentiation to T cells. miR-146a and miR-150 were separately and jointly transduced to human cord blood derived CD133(+) cells (&gt;97% purity). We used qRT-PCR to assess the expression of CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, T cell receptor alpha (TCR-) and Ikaros genes in differentiated cells 4 and 8days after transduction of the miRNAs. Following the over-expression of miR-146a, significant up-regulation of CD2, CD4, CD25 and Ikaros genes were observed (P&lt;0.01). On the other hand, over-expression of miR-150 caused an increase in the expression of Ikaros, CD4, CD25 and TCR-. To evaluate the combinatorial effect of miR-146a and miR-150, transduction of both miRNAs was concurrently performed which led to increase in the expression of Ikaros, CD4 and CD3 genes. In conclusion, it seems that the effect of miR-150 and miR-146a on the promotion of T cell differentiation is time-dependant. Moreover, miRNAs could be used either as substitutes or complements of the conventional differentiation protocols for higher efficiency.
