microRNA-10b: a new marker or the marker of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma? microRNA-10b (miR-10b) expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), as identified by in situ hybridization, is highly correlated with cancer diagnosis, therapy response, and prognosis. If these findings are further confirmed in prospective studies, miR-10b could be used to improve the management of PDAC and decrease the mortality rate of this deadly cancer.
