Roles of microRNA-29a in the antifibrotic effect of farnesoid X receptor in hepatic stellate cells. Liver fibrosis is a chronic disorder that is characterized by an alteration of the balance between fibrogenesis and fibrinolysis, which results in accumulation of excessive amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM) and distortion of the normal liver architecture. The activation and transformation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into myofibroblast-like cells constitute a major mechanism for the increased production of ECM in the liver. The nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) shows potent antifibrotic activity in HSCs and protects animals in rodent models of liver fibrosis. However, the detailed mechanism remains incompletely understood. In this study, we report that treatment with 3-[2-[2-chloro-4-[[3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-(1-methylethyl)-4-isoxazolyl]methoxy]phenyl]ethenyl]benzoic acid (GW4064), a synthetic FXR ligand, led to up-regulation of microRNA-29a (miR-29a) in HSCs isolated from wild-type mice, rats, and humans but not from FXR(-/-) mice. miR-29a seems to play an inhibitory role in the regulation of ECM production because of the following: 1) transfection of HSCs with miR-29a mimic resulted in drastic down-regulation of the mRNA expression of several genes that encode ECM proteins; and 2) miR-29a significantly inhibited the expression of a reporter expression plasmid that contains the 3'-untranslated region of the corresponding ECM genes. Our results suggest that miR-29a is a FXR target gene because miR-29a promoter activity was significantly increased by pharmacologic or genetic activation of FXR. Functional analysis of human miR-29a promoter identified an imperfect inverted repeat spaced by one nucleotide DNA motif, inverted repeat-1 (5'-AGGTCAcAGACCT-3'), as a likely FXR-responsive element that is involved in miR-29a regulation. Our study uncovers a new mechanism by which FXR negatively regulates the expression of ECM in HSCs.
