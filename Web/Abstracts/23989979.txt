A Tumorigenic Factor Interactome Connected Through Tumor Suppressor MicroRNA-198 in Human Pancreatic Cancer. The majority of pancreatic cancers (PCs) overexpress mesothelin (MSLN), which contributes to enhanced proliferation, invasion and migration. However, the MSLN regulatory network is still unclear. Here, we investigated the regulation of a panel of tumorigenic factors, and explored the potential of MSLN regulated miR-198 treatment in vivo. The expression and functional regulation of the tumorigenic factors MSLN, NF-B, and the homeobox transcription factors (TFs) POU2F2 (OCT-2), Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox factor 1 (PBX-1), valosin-containing protein (VCP), and miR-198 were studied in PC cell lines, patient tumor samples and in xenograft PC mouse models. We found that miR-198 is downregulated in PC and is involved in an intricate reciprocal regulatory loop with MSLN, which represses miR-198 through NF-B-mediated OCT-2 induction. Furthermore, miR-198 repression leads to overexpression of PBX-1 and VCP. The dysregulated PBX-1/VCP axis leads to increased tumorigenicity. Reconstitution of miR-198 in PC cells results in reduced tumor growth, metastasis, and increased survival through direct targeting MSLN, PBX-1, and VCP. Most interestingly, reduced levels of miR-198 in human tissue samples are associated with upregulation of these tumorigenic factors (MSLN, OCT-2, PBX-1, VCP) and predict poor survival. Reduced miR-198 expression links this tumor network signature and prognosticates poor patient outcome. High miR-198 disrupts the network and predicts better prognosis and increased survival. MiR-198 acts as a central tumor suppressor and modulates the molecular makeup of a critical interactome in PC, indicating a potential prognostic marker signature and the therapeutic potential of attacking this tumorigenic network through a central vantage point.
