The miR-302-367 cluster as a potential stemness regulator in ESCs. Increasing experimental evidence suggests an important role of miRNAs in embryonic stem cell (ESC) biology. The miR-302-367 cluster is exclusively expressed at high levels in ESCs but not in either somatic stem cells or adult/embryonic differentiated cells. The human miR-302-367 gene structure has been recently described and its promoter has been identified, characterized and functionally validated in human stem cells. The miR-302-367 promoter activity depends on the ontogeny and hierarchical cellular stage. The miR-302-367 promoter is transcriptionally regulated by the ESC-specific transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2 and Nanog and, its activity restricted to the ESC compartment. Functionally, this cluster regulates cell cycle in ESCs promoting self-renewal and pluripotency, therefore representing a master regulator in the maintenance of hESC stemness. We envision this data may open up new avenues to investigate the transcriptional regulators upstream miR-302-367 cluster and to dissect the complex interplay by which this miR-302-367 cluster integrates in the molecular network conferring pluripotency to ESCs. In this perspective, we summarize recent progress in the genomic and functional characterization of the miR-302-367 cluster and discuss its potential as a stemness determinant.
