miR-146a is differentially expressed by myeloid dendritic cell subsets and desensitizes cells to TLR2-dependent activation. Langerhans cells (LCs) in epithelia and interstitial dendritic cells (intDCs) in adjacent connective tissues represent two closely related myeloid-derived DC subsets that exert specialized functions in the immune system and are of clinical relevance for cell therapy. Both subsets arise from monocyte-committed intermediates in response to tissue-associated microenvironmental signals; however, molecular mechanisms underlying myeloid DC subset specification and function remain poorly defined. Using microarray profiling, we identified microRNA (miRNA) miR-146a to be constitutively expressed at higher levels in human LCs compared with intDCs. Moreover, miR-146a levels were low in monocytes and nondetectable in neutrophil granulocytes. Interestingly, constitutive high miR-146a expression in LCs is induced by the transcription factor PU.1 in response to TGF-beta1, a key microenvironmental signal for epidermal LC differentiation. We identified miR-146a as a regulator of monocyte and DC activation but not myeloid/DC subset differentiation. Ectopic miR-146a in monocytes and intDCs interfered with TLR2 downstream signaling and cytokine production, without affecting phenotypic DC maturation. Inversely, silencing of miR-146a in LCs enhanced TLR2-dependent NF-kappaB signaling. We therefore conclude that high constitutive miR-146a levels are induced by microenvironmental signals in the epidermis and might render LCs less susceptible to inappropriate activation by commensal bacterial TLR2 triggers at body surfaces.
