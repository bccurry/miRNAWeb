Re-expression of miR-200 by novel approaches regulates the expression of PTEN and MT1-MMP in pancreatic cancer. Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is often activated and expressed in tumor cells with significant invasive properties, and is associated with poor prognosis of patients. This could partly be due to deregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) which regulates the expression of MT1-MMP and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) contributing to tumor invasion and metastasis. We initially compared the expression profile of miR-200 family, PTEN and MT1-MMP expression in six pancreatic cancer (PC) cell lines by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. We found loss of expression of miR-200a, b and c in chemo-resistant PC cell lines, which was correlated with loss of PTEN and over-expression of MT1-MMP. Based on our initial findings, we chose BxPC-3, MIAPaCa-2 and MIAPaCa-2-GR cells for further mechanistic studies We assessed the effect of two separate novel agents CDF (a synthetic analog of curcumin) and BR-DIM (a natural agent) on PC cells. The expression of miR-200 family and PTEN was significantly re-expressed whereas the expression of MT1-MMP was down-regulated by CDF and BR-DIM treatment. Forced over-expression or silencing of miR-200c, followed by either CDF or BR-DIM treatment of MIAPaCa-2 cells, altered the morphology of cells, wound-healing capacity, colony formation and the expression of MT1-MMP and PTEN. These results provide strong experimental evidence showing that the loss of miR-200 family and PTEN expression and increased level of MT1-MMP leads to aggressive behavior of PC cells, which could be attenuated through re-expression of miR-200c by CDF and/or BR-DIM treatment, suggesting that these agents could be useful for PC treatment.
