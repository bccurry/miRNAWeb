Microarray profiling of monocytic differentiation reveals miRNA-mRNA intrinsic correlation. MiRNAs (microRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in mammalian gene expression of cellular processes including differentiation, apoptosis and cancer development. Both specific miRNAs and mRNAs have been identified during monocytic differentiation, but their interactions have not been fully characterized. Here we report that by genome-wide microarray analysis for U937 monocytic differentiation induced by TPA, a large number of miRNAs and mRNAs were differentially expressed, and by bioinformatics analysis could demonstrate that their functional pathway patterns overlap strongly. While expected negative correlation between the expression levels of miRNAs and their target mRNAs was seen, several positive correlations between miRNAs and host mRNAs were also observed, such as C13orf25/miR17, MCM7/miR93, and MGC14376/miR22. These microarray data were verified by quantitative RT-PCR, and the TPA-induced differentiation of U937 cells was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. Our study suggests an intrinsic correlation between miRNAs and mRNAs underlying their interactions which would provide new insights for defining the mechanisms occurring during monocytic differentiation.
