MicroRNA-203 down-regulation is associated with unfavorable prognosis in human glioma. MicroRNA-203 (miR-203) serves as a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter in different human malignancies. However, its involvement in human gliomas is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of miR-203 expression in gliomas. Real-time quantitative PCR was employed to measure the expression level of miR-203 in clinical glioma tissues. The expression of miR-203 was reduced in high WHO grade glioma tissues compared with that in low WHO grade and normal brain tissues, and decreased with ascending tumor WHO grades (P&lt;0.001). The reduced miR-203 expression in gliomas was significantly associated with higher WHO grade (P&lt;0.001), lower KPS score (P=0.008) and poorer disease-specific survival of patients (P=0.001). More importantly, subgroup analyses according to tumor WHO grade revealed that the disease-specific survival of patients with low miR-203 expression in high WHO grades (III-IV) subgroup was significantly shorter than those with high miR-203 expression (P&lt;0.001), but no significant difference was found for patients in WHO grades I-II subgroup (P=0.08). Our data validate an important clinical significance of miR-203 in gliomas, and reveal that it might be an intrinsic regulator of tumor progression and a potential prognostic factor for this dismal disease.
