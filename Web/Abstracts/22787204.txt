Hepatitis C virus infection modulates expression of interferon stimulatory gene IFITM1 by upregulating miR-130A. We have examined the underlying mechanism of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-mediated IFITM1 regulation. IFITM1 is a potential target of miR-130a. Our results demonstrated that miR-130a expression was significantly higher in HCV-infected hepatocytes and liver biopsy specimens than in controls. Introduction of anti-miR-130a in hepatocytes increased IFITM1 expression. Hepatocytes stably expressing IFITM1 reduced HCV replication. Together, these results suggested that HCV infection of hepatocytes upregulates miR-130a and that use of anti-miR-130a may have potential for restriction of HCV replication.
