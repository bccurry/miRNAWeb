Angiogenesis within the duodenum of patients with cirrhosis is modulated by mechanosensitive Kruppel-like factor 2 and microRNA-126. BACKGROUND: The mechanism involved in neovascularization in splanchnic circulation and the main trigger that induces angiogenesis in patients with cirrhosis are not fully recognized. AIMS: To explore the involvement of flow sensitive lung Kruppel-like factor (KLF2), microRNA-126 (miR-126), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in modulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling that have a critical effect on growth of new blood vessels. METHODS: Duodenal biopsies from 22 patients with cirrhosis and 10 controls were obtained during routine endoscopy. The process of angiogenesis was evaluated by a measurement of CD31 concentration, immunodetection of CD34 protein and estimation of capillary densities. Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions were analysed by real-time PCR, Western blot or ELISA respectively. RESULTS: Markers of angiogenesis (both, CD31 and CD34) were significantly enhanced in cirrhotic patients. In comparison to healthy controls, levels of Ang-2 and KLF-2 mRNAs as well as Ang-2, KLF-2, HO-1, VEGF protein expressions were considerably increased. Levels of sCD163, a surrogate marker of portal hypertension, correlated with levels of Ang-2, (P=0.021) and VEGF (P=0.009). The expression of miR-126, a KLF2-mediated regulator of the VEGF signalling was enhanced in cirrhotic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate, for the first time in humans, that neovascularization is induced in duodenal tissue of patients with cirrhosis and proangiogenic factors such as KLF-2, Ang-2, miR-126 and VEGF can contribute to the angiogenesis induced by hemodynamic forces. Thus, cirrhosis-induced blood flow and pressure within splanchnic vessels may be important hemodynamic triggers that initiate the angiogenic signalling cascade.
