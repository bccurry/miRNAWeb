MicroRNA gene expression in malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. To review the recent studies about microRNAs and advances in malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. Published articles (2001 - 2006) about microRNAs and malignant lymphoproliferative disorders were selected using MEDLINE. After independent review by two observers, 43 of 421 originally identified articles were selected that specifically addressed the stated purpose. Two observers independently assessed studies using explicit methodological criteria for evaluating microRNAs in malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. Recent work has revealed a class of small noncoding RNA species, microRNAs, which affect various biological processes. MicroRNAs inhibit the expression of protein encoding genes at the posttranscriptional level in a variety of eukaryotic organisms. In this review, we focused on the biogenetic pathways of microRNAs (miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-155, miR-17-92 cluster, miR-142) and discussed the implications for human malignant lymphoproliferative disorders. microRNAs are involved in tumorigenesis and mediate gene regulation as a fundamental genetic program at the posttranscriptional level. Further study of microRNAs may lead to novel concepts in the diagnosis and treatment of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders.
