microRNA-181b targets MLK2 in HL-60 cells. microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in many different cellular processes, including metabolism, apoptosis, differentiation and development. We showed miR-181b to be highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, miR-181b contributed to proliferation of AML cells by targeting MLK2. Our results demonstrated that miR-181b plays an important role in the biology of AML and may be useful in developing therapies targeting miRNAs.
