SOCS1 is significantly up-regulated in Nutlin-3-treated p53wild-type B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) samples and shows an inverse correlation with miR-155. The basal SOCS1 mRNA levels were significantly lower in p53(mutated) BJAB and MAVER leukemic cell lines with respect to p53(wild-type) SKW6.4 and JVM-2 leukemic cell lines, p53(wild-type) primary B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells and primary normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Moreover, the MDM2 small molecule inhibitor Nutlin-3 significantly increased the levels of SOCS1 mRNA in both primary p53(wild-type) B-CLL cells as well as in p53(wild-type) B leukemic cell lines, but not in p53(mutated) B leukemic cell lines nor in primary PBMC. Of note, a significant inverse correlation was observed between SOCS1 mRNA and miR-155 levels in Nutlin-3-treated primary B-CLL cells and PBMC, suggesting that the miRNA-155/SOCS1 axis represents a potentially important therapeutic target of Nutlin-3 in B-CLL.
