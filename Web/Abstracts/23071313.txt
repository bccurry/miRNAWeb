IL-10-induced microRNA-187 negatively regulates TNF-, IL-6, and IL-12p40 production in TLR4-stimulated monocytes. IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory molecule that, in phagocytes, negatively targets cytokine expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Posttranscriptional checkpoints also represent the specific target of a recently discovered, evolutionary conserved class of small silencing RNAs known as &quot;microRNAs&quot; (miRNAs), which display the peculiar function of negatively regulating mRNA processing, stability, and translation. In this study, we report that activation of primary human monocytes up-regulates the expression of miR-187 both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, we identify miR-187 as an IL-10-dependent miRNA playing a role in IL-10-mediated suppression of TNF-, IL-6, and the p40 subunit of IL-12 (IL-12p40) produced by primary human monocytes following activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Ectopic expression of miR-187 consistently and selectively reduces TNF, IL-6, and IL-12p40 produced by LPS-activated monocytes. Conversely, the production of LPS-induced TNF-, IL-6, and IL-12p40 is increased significantly when miR-187 expression is silenced. Our data demonstrate that miR-187 directly targets TNF- mRNA stability and translation and indirectly decreases IL-6 and IL-12p40 expression via down-modulation of IB, a master regulator of the transcription of these latter two cytokines. These results uncover an miRNA-mediated pathway controlling cytokine expression and demonstrate a central role of miR-187 in the physiological regulation of IL-10-driven anti-inflammatory responses.
