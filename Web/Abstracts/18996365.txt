Detection of miR-106a in gastric carcinoma and its clinical significance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in carcinogenesis. miRNA-106a (miR-106a) has oncogenic activity in humans, and often has altered expression. The clinical significance of miR-106a in the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma is poorly understood. The level of miR-106a in 55 gastric carcinoma and 17 non-tumor tissues was quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and the relationship between miR-106a level and clinical and pathological factors was explored. The level of miR-106a in cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in non-tumor tissues, with an average 1.625-fold increase. miR-106a level was significantly associated with tumor stage, size and differentiation; lymphatic and distant metastasis; and invasion (P&lt;0.01). The altered expression of miR-106a was confirmed in gastric cancer cell lines. miR-106a may be a potential biomarker in the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma.
