MiR-142-3p as a potential prognostic biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs, are always aberrantly expressed in many diseases including human cancers. The aim of this study was to examine and determine the clinical significance of hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-142-3p, hsa-miR-338-3p, and hsa-miR-1261 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Expression levels of four selected miRNAs, initially evaluated by microarray, were validated by qRT-PCR. Various statistical methods were used to analyze the relationship between miRNA expression and clinicopathologic features and prognosis in 91 patients with ESCC. MiR-31 and miR-142-3p expression were correlated to histological differentiation in ESCC (P&lt;0.05, Student's t-test); high miR-142-3p expression was associated with a poor prognosis in all 91 ESCC patients (P=0.014, log-rank) and identified as an independent prognostic factor in ESCC (P=0.017, univariate Cox; P=0.022, multivariate Cox). More importantly, stratified analysis indicated that high miR-142-3p expression was correlated to a poor prognosis within good-prognosis groups comprised of ESCC patients with small tumor size, negative lymph node metastasis, or early stage (all P&lt;0.05). The main findings suggest that miR-142-3p is involved in the progression of ESCC and is a potential prognostic biomarker for ESCC.
