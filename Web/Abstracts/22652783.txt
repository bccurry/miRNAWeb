Role of miR-155 in breast cancer. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death due to cancer in women. Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between overexpression of miR-155 and breast cancer development. The microRNA (miRNA) encoded by mir-155 is known to be oncogenic in multiple tumors. This review summarizes the signaling pathways that are regulated by miR-155 in breast cancer and discusses therapeutic possibilities related to miR-155.
