miR-203 modulates epithelial differentiation of human embryonic stem cells towards epidermal stratification. The molecular mechanisms controlling the differentiation of human basal keratinocyte stem cells towards the epidermis are well characterized, whereas the earliest process leading to the specification of embryonic stem cells into keratinocytes is still not well understood. MicroRNAs are regulators of many cellular events, but evidence for microRNA acting on the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into a specific lineage has been elusive. By using our recent protocol for obtaining functional keratinocytes from hESC, we attempted to analyze the role of microRNAs in the early stages of epidermal differentiation. Thus, we identified a set of 5 microRNAs, namely miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-203, miR-205 and miR-429, that are specifically overexpressed during the early stages of the differentiation process. Interestingly, our functional analyses revealed an instrumental role of miR-203, which had been previously shown to play a key role during the formation of the pluristratified epidermis by basal keratinocyte stem cells, in the early keratinocyte commitment. These results highlight the determinant and unique role of miR-203 during the entire process of epidermal development by extending its spectrum of action from the early commitment of embryonic stem cells to ultimate differentiation of the organ.
