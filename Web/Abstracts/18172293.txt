Distinctive microRNA profiles relating to patient survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of death from cancer and one of the least studied cancers worldwide. The global microRNA expression profile of esophageal cancer has not been reported previously. Here, for the first time, we have investigated expressed microRNAs in cryopreserved esophageal cancer tissues using advanced microRNA microarray techniques. Our microarray analyses identified seven microRNAs that could distinguish malignant esophageal cancer lesions from adjacent normal tissues. Some microRNAs could be correlated with the different clinicopathologic classifications. High expression of hsa-miR-103/107 correlated with poor survival by univariate analysis as well as by multivariate analysis. These results indicate that microRNA expression profiles are important diagnostic and prognostic markers of esophageal cancer, which might be analyzed simply using economical approaches such as reverse transcription-PCR.
