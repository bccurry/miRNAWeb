The Journal of Pathology 2008 Jeremy Jass Prize for Research Excellence in Pathology. The first Jass Prize for Research Excellence has been awarded to a group from Hannover in Germany. These authors discovered the epigenetic inactivation of microRNA gene hsa-mir-9-1 in human breast cancer and characterized its biological and clinical relevance. This frequent epigenetic silencing was found to occur early in the development of breast cancer, and illustrates another mechanism by which tumour development is influenced by genes that operate without expression as proteins.
