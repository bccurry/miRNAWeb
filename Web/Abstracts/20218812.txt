miR-451 enhances erythroid differentiation in K562 cells. Erythropoiesis is a multistep process regulated at the molecular level by intrinsic and extrinsic factors including microRNAs (miRNAs). We previously identified aberrant expression of miR-451 and miR-150 in polycythemia vera (PV) erythroid differentiating cells. To address the functional relevance of these miRNAs in erythroid differentiation, we employed synthetic mimics and inhibitors of miR-451 and miR-150 in erythroid differentiating K562 cells. We observed that miR-451 up-regulation and miR-150 down-regulation are associated with progression of erythroid maturation in K562 cells. Further, enforced expression of miR-451 promoted erythroid differentiation. Inhibition of miR-150 reduced hemoglobinization of K562 cells. Microarray data suggested potential targets regulated by miR-451: UBE2H, ARPP-19; and by miR-150: MS4A3, AGA, PTPRR. Our results demonstrate that miR-451 is involved in the regulation of erythroid differentiation and functions as an enhancer of differentiation. These data support the concept that aberrant expression of miRNAs may contribute to abnormal erythropoiesis such as that of PV.
