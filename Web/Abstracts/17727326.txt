MicroRNA expression in lymphoma. MicroRNAs are a recently discovered class of short (approximately 22 nucleotide) naturally occurring RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. There has been an explosion of interest in the microRNA field as these molecules have been found to play key roles in a wide range of biological processes and to be aberrantly expressed in many types of cancer, including haematological malignancies. Cancer-associated microRNAs can act as both tumour suppressor molecules (e.g., miR-15a and miR-16-1) and have oncogenic properties (e.g., miR-155 and miR-17-92 cluster). In this review the authors discuss the rapidly accumulating evidence for the central role that microRNAs play in both haematopoiesis and haematological malignancy, in particular focusing on their role in lymphoma.
