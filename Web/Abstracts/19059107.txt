Changes in regulatory microRNA expression in myocardium of heart failure patients on left ventricular assist device support. Left ventricular assist device support in heart failure patients leads to changes in mRNA and protein expression in the myocardium. MicroRNA's are important regulators of various cellular processes, so changes in their expression were tested by Q-PCR methods. LVAD support (independently of the duration) leads to a decrease of the expression of miR-1, miR-133a and miR-133b in DCM patients but to an increase in expression in IHD patients. The expression of miR's pre- and post-LVAD in heart failure patients was low compared to the level of miR's in control myocardial tissue. Alterations in miRs expression might also be important during repair processes in IHD patients.
