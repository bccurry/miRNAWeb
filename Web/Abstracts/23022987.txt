Acute myeloid leukemia with translocation (8;16)(p11;p13) and MYST3-CREBBP rearrangement harbors a distinctive microRNA signature targeting RET proto-oncogene. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;16)(p11;p13) (t(8;16) AML) has unique clinico-biological characteristics, but its microRNA pattern is unknown. We analyzed 670 microRNAs in seven patients with t(8;16) AML and 113 with other AML subtypes. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that all t(8;16) AML patients grouped in an independent cluster. Supervised analysis revealed a distinctive signature of 94-microRNAs, most of which were downregulated, including miR-21 and cluster miR-17-92. The mRNA expression analysis of two known transcription factors of these microRNAs (STAT3 and c-Myc, respectively) showed significant downregulation of STAT3 (P=0.04). A bioinformatic analysis showed that 29 of the downregulated microRNAs might be regulated by methylation; we treated a t(8;16) AML sample with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-dC) and trichostatin A and found that 27 microRNAs were re-expressed after treatment. However, there was no difference in methylation status between t(8;16) and other AML subtypes, either overall or in the microRNA promoter. Cross-correlation of mRNA and microRNA expression identified RET as a potential target of several microRNAs. A Renilla-luciferase assay and flow cytometry after transfection with pre-microRNAs confirmed that RET is regulated by miR-218, miR-128, miR-27b, miR-15a and miR-195. In conclusion, t(8;16) AML harbors a specific microRNA signature that is partially epigenetically regulated and targets RET proto-oncogene.
