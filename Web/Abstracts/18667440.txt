c-Myb is an evolutionary conserved miR-150 target and miR-150/c-Myb interaction is important for embryonic development. Human c-Myb proto-oncogene is highly expressed in hematopoietic progenitors as well as leukemia and certain solid tumor. However, the regulatory mechanisms of its expression and biological functions remain largely unclear. Recently, c-Myb has been shown to be targeted by microRNA-150 (miR-150) which thereby controls B cell differentiation in mice. In this study, we demonstrated that c-Myb is an evolutionary conserved target of miR-150 in human and zebrafish, using reporter assays. Ectopic expression of miR-150 in breast cancer and leukemic cells repressed endogenous c-Myb at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Among several leukemia cell lines, primary leukemia cells, and normal lymphocytes, expression levels of miR-150 inversely correlated with c-Myb. The miR-150 overexpression or c-Myb silencing in zebrafish zygotes led to similar and serious phenotypic defects in zebrafish, and the phenotypic aberrations induced by miR-150 could be reversed by coinjection of c-Myb mRNA. Our findings suggest that c-Myb is an evolutionally conserved target of miR-150 and miR-150/c-Myb interaction is important for embryonic development and possibly oncogenesis.
