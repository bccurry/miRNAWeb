[Alteration of mi-RNA expression profile after interferon treatment in HCV-infected Huh7.5.1 cells]. To screen the mi-RNA expression profile after interferon treatment in cells infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Huh-7.5.1 cells was infected with HCV by in vitro transcription and cultured with interferon. The mi-RNA microarray was used to measure the mi-RNA expression in the control group, HCV transcription group and interference group. Intra-group differences were analyzed by the 2 ((-delt delt CT)) method. With mi-RNA expressed in normal Huh-7.5.1 cells as a benchmark, expressions of 13 kinds of mi-RNAs were up-regulated after HCV infection and then down-regulated following interferon treatment; 7 were down-regulated after HCV infection and then up-regulated following interferon treatment. mi-RNA10a, mi-RNA21, mi-RNA149, mi-RNA152 and mi-RNA210 may be related to hepatitis C virus replication and transcription.
