Role of miR-34c microRNA in the late steps of spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis is a cyclic process in which diploid spermatogonia differentiate into haploid spermatozoa. This process is highly regulated, notably at the post-transcriptional level. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), single-stranded noncoding RNA molecules of about 20-25 nucleotides, are implicated in the regulation of many important biological pathways such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. We wondered whether miRNAs could play a role during spermatogenesis. The miRNA expression repertoire was tested in germ cells, and we present data showing that miR-34c was highly expressed only in these cells. Furthermore, our findings indicate that in male gonads, miR-34c expression is largely p53 independent in contrast to previous results showing a direct link in somatic cells between the miR-34 family and this tumor suppressor protein. In order to identify target genes involved in germinal lineage differentiation, we overexpressed miR-34c in HeLa cells, analyzed the transcriptome of these modified cells, and noticed a shift of the expression profile toward the germinal lineage. Recently, it has been shown that exogenous expression of Ddx4/Vasa in embryonic chicken stem cells (cESC) induces cESC reprogramming toward a germ cell fate. When we simultaneously expressed miR-34c in such cells, we could detect an up-regulation of germ cell-specific genes whereas the expression of other lineage specific markers remained unchanged. These data suggest that miR-34c could play a role by enhancing the germinal phenotype of cells already committed to this lineage.
