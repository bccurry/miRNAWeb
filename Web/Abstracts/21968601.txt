MicroRNA-146a modulates TGF-1-induced phenotypic differentiation in human dermal fibroblasts by targeting SMAD4. During wound healing and tissue repair the dermal fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation plays an important role, transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) is considered to be the main stimuli factor of transdifferentiation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. The involvement of miRNAs and their roles in TGF-1-induced myofibroblast transdifferentiation remains to be determined in detail. The current study found that the expression of miR-146a was upregulated in human dermal fibroblasts cells in response to TGF-1 stimulation in dose-dependent manner by quantitative RT-PCR. Bioinformatic analyses predict that signaling effectors mothers against decapentaplegic protein 4 (SMAD4) is a miR-146a target gene. Luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-146a mimics suppressed SMAD4 3'-UTR reporter construct activity. Furthermore, miR-146a overexpression in dermal fibroblast did not decrease target mRNA levels, but significantly reduced target protein expression. In addition, dermal fibroblasts transfected with miR-146a mimics exhibited attenuated TGF-1 -induced -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) expression compared with the control. This study demonstrated that miR-146a may function as a novel negative regulator to modulate myofibroblast transdifferentiation during TGF-1 induction by targeting SMAD4.
