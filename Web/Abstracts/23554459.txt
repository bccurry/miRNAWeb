MicroRNA-638 is highly expressed in human vascular smooth muscle cells and inhibits PDGF-BB-induced cell proliferation and migration through targeting orphan nuclear receptor NOR1. Aberrant vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration contribute significantly to the development of vascular pathologies, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. MicroRNAs have recently emerged as critical modulators in cellular processes and the purpose of this study is to identify novel miRNA regulators implicated in human aortic VSMC proliferation and migration. To identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed in human VSMCs, we performed miRNA microarray analysis in human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) at different time points after platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulation. Here, we identified microRNA-638 (miR-638) as a transcript that was one of the most significantly down-regulated in human VSMCs after PDGF stimulation. Furthermore, we confirmed, by Quantitative RT-PCR, that miR-638 is highly expressed in human VSMCs, and its expression is markedly down-regulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner upon PDGF treatment. Consistent with a critical role in SMC proliferation, we found that miR-638 expression was significantly up-regulated in human VSMCs cultured in differentiation medium, a condition that inhibits SMC proliferation. Furthermore, we identified the orphan nuclear receptor NOR1 as a downstream target gene product of miR-638 and down-regulation of NOR1 is critical for miR-638-mediated inhibitory effects on PDGF-induced cyclin D1 expression, cell proliferation, and migration in human aortic SMCs. These results indicate that miR-638 is a key molecule in regulating human VSMC proliferation and migration by targeting the NOR1/cyclin D pathway and suggest that specific modulation of miR-638 in human VSMCs may represent an attractive approach for the treatment of proliferative vascular diseases.
