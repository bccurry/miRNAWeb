MicroRNA as repressors of stress-induced anxiety: the case of amygdalar miR-34. The etiology and pathophysiology of anxiety and mood disorders is linked to inappropriate regulation of the central stress response. To determine whether microRNAs have a functional role in the regulation of the stress response, we inactivated microRNA processing by a lentiviral-induced local ablation of the Dicer gene in the central amygdala (CeA) of adult mice. CeA Dicer ablation induced a robust increase in anxiety-like behavior, whereas manipulated neurons survive and appear to exhibit normal gross morphology in the time period examined. We also observed that acute stress in wild-type mice induced a differential expression profile of microRNAs in the amygdala. Bioinformatic analysis identified putative gene targets for these stress-responsive microRNAs, some of which are known to be associated with stress. One of the prominent stress-induced microRNAs found in this screen, miR-34c, was further confirmed to be upregulated after acute and chronic stressful challenge and downregulated in Dicer ablated cells. Lentivirally mediated overexpression of miR34c specifically within the adult CeA induced anxiolytic behavior after challenge. Of particular interest, one of the miR-34c targets is the stress-related corticotropin releasing factor receptor type 1 (CRFR1) mRNA, regulated via a single evolutionary conserved seed complementary site on its 3' UTR. Additional in vitro studies demonstrated that miR-34c reduces the responsiveness of cells to CRF in neuronal cells endogenously expressing CRFR1. Our results suggest a physiological role for microRNAs in regulating the central stress response and position them as potential targets for treatment of stress-related disorders.
