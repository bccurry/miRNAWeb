microRNA-195 promotes apoptosis and suppresses tumorigenicity of human colorectal cancer cells. Deregulated microRNAs and their roles in cancer development have attracted much attention. In the present study, we analyzed the roles of miR-195 in colorectal cancer pathogenesis, as its participation in some other types of cancer has been suggested by previous reports. By comparing miR-195 expression in 81 human colorectal cancer tissues and matched non-neoplastic mucosa tissues, we found that miR-195 was downregulated in cancer tissues. And restoration of miR-195 in colorectal cancer cell lines HT29 and LoVo could reduce cell viability, promote cell apoptosis and suppress tumorigenicity. Moreover, important antiapoptotic Bcl-2 was identified to be directly targeted by miR-195, and miR-195 was further suggested to exert its proapoptotic function mainly through targeting Bcl-2 expression. Taken together, our study provides important roles of miR-195 in colorectal cancer pathogenesis and implicates its potential application in cancer therapy.
