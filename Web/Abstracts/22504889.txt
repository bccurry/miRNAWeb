Regulatory role of miR-2909 in cell-mediated immune response. Keeping in view the micromanagement of immune response by micro RNAs, the present study was directed to explore the role of miR-2909 in the differentiation and maturation of T-lymphocytes within the population of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells maintained in in vitro culture. The results of such a study revealed that miR-2909 had the inherent capacity to significantly increase Treg (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) cell population and dominant Th1-type cytokine (especially with decrease in IL-4 level and higher levels of INF- and INF-) profile. Based upon these results, we propose that miR-2909 may modulate native immunity in general and help in providing protective immunity against viral infections in particular.
