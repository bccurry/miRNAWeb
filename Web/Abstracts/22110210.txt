Down-regulation of MiR-206 promotes proliferation and invasion of laryngeal cancer by regulating VEGF expression. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of their target genes. The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of miR-206 on laryngeal suamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cells. The expression level of miR-206 was quantified by qRT-PCR in primary LSCC tissues and corresponding adjacent non-neoplastic tissues. MTT, Matrigel invasion assays and flow cytometry methods were used to test the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis of MiR-206 transfection LSCC cells and a mouse model was used to investigate tumorigenesis. MiR-206 was significantly down regulated in the LSCC tissues. Inverse correlation of miR-206 expression was found with the T grade, nodal metastasis and clinical stage of LSCC. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenesis in the LSCC cells were significantly inhibited and apoptotic cells were also increased after miR-206 tansfection. Furthermore, miR-206 transfection down-regulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the LSCC cells. The loss of miR-206 may play an important role in the progress of LSCC and miR-206 may function as a novel tumor suppressed miRNA.
