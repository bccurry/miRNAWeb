Consecutive targetable smart nanoprobe for molecular recognition of cytoplasmic microRNA in metastatic breast cancer. We report smart nanoprobe, hyaluronic acid (HA)-based nanocontainers containing miR-34a beacons (bHNCs), for the intracellular recognition of miR-34a levels in metastatic breast cancer cells, which is distinct from the imaging of biomarkers such of cell membrane receptors such as HER2. In this study, we demonstrate that a nanoscale vesicle that couples a targeting endocytic route, CD44, and a molecular imaging probe enables the efficient detection of specific miRNAs. Furthermore, bHNCs showed no cytotoxicity and high stability due to the anchored HA molecules on the surface of nanocontainers, and enables the targeted delivery of beacons via CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis. In vitro and in vivo optical imaging using bHNCs also allow the measurement of miR-34a expression levels due to the selective recognition of the beacons released from the internalized bHNCs. We believe that the technique described herein can be further developed as a cancer diagnostic as well as a miRNA-based therapy of metastatic cancer.
