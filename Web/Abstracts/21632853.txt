Clinical significance of miR-146a in gastric cancer cases. The profiles of microRNAs change significantly in gastric cancer. MiR-146a is reported to be a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. We investigated the clinical significance of miR-146a in gastric cancer, in particular focusing on hypothetical miR-146a target genes, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1). We examined miR-146a levels in 90 gastric cancer samples by q-real-time (qRT)-PCR and analyzed the association between miR-146a levels and clinicopathologic factors and prognosis. The regulation of EGFR and IRAK1 by miR-146a was examined with miR-146a-transfected gastric cancer cells. Moreover, we analyzed the association between miR-146a levels and the G/C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within pre-miR-146a seed sequences in 76 gastric cancer samples, using direct sequencing of genomic DNA. In 90 clinical samples of gastric cancer, miR-146a levels in cancer tissues were significantly lower than those in the corresponding noncancerous tissue (P &lt; 0.001). Lower levels of miR-146a were associated with lymph node metastasis and venous invasion (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, a lower level of miR-146a was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P = 0.003). Ectopic expression of miR-146a inhibited migration and invasion and downregulated EGFR and IRAK1 expression in gastric cancer cells. In addition, G/C SNP within the pre-miR-146a seed sequence significantly reduced miR-146a levels in the GG genotype compared with the CC genotype. MiR-146a contains an SNP, which is associated with mature miR-146a expression. MiR-146a targeting of EGFR and IRAK1 is an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer cases.
