Estrogen receptor  expression induces changes in the microRNA pool in human colon cancer cells. There is epidemiological, animal and in vitro evidence that estrogen receptor  (ER) can mediate protective effects against colon cancer, but the mechanism is not completely understood. Previous research has indicated critical pathways whereby ER acts in an antitumorigenic fashion. In this study, we investigate ER's impact on the microRNA (miRNA) pool in colon cancer cells using large-scale genomic approaches, bioinformatics and focused functional studies. We detect and confirm 27 miRNAs to be significantly changed following ER expression in SW480 colon cancer cells. Among these, the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster and miR-200a/b are strongly downregulated. Using target prediction and anticorrelation to gene expression data followed by focused mechanistic studies, we demonstrate that repression of miR-17 is a secondary event following ER's downregulatory effect on MYC. We show that re-introduction of miR-17 can reverse the antiproliferative effects of ER. The repression of miR-17 also influences cell death upon DNA damage and mediates regulation of NCOA3 (SRC-3) and CLU in colon cancer cells. We further determine that the downregulation of miR-200a/b mediates increased ZEB1 while decreasing E-cadherin levels in ER-expressing colon cancer cells. Changes in these genes correspond to significant alterations in morphology and migration. Our work contributes novel data of ER and miRNA in the colon. Elucidating the mechanism of ER and biomarkers of its activity has significant potential to impact colon cancer prevention and treatment.
