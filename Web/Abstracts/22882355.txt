Association of the miR-146aC&gt;G, miR-149T&gt;C, miR-196a2T&gt;C, and miR-499A&gt;G polymorphisms with risk of spontaneously aborted fetuses. The miR-196a2T&gt;C and miR-499A&gt;G polymorphisms have been reported to be genetic risk factors for recurrent spontaneous abortion; however, that previous study focused on the genetic analyses of pregnant women rather than aborted fetuses. Because annexin A1 is a target of miR-196a2 and is related to anti-inflammation, miR-196a2 may be immunologically important. Moreover, miR-146a, miR-149, miR-196a2, and miR-499 have shown associations with immune responses. One hundred and eighty-two spontaneously aborted fetuses (SAFs) were &lt;20 weeks of gestational age. The control subjects were 101 healthy children and 302 adults collected from a convenience sample. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed to identify the miR-146aC&gt;G, miR-149T&gt;C, miR-196a2T&gt;C, and miR-499A&gt;G genotypes. Chromosomally normal SAFs had significantly different frequencies of the miR-196a2CC, miR-146aCC/miR-196a2CC, and miR-149TT/miR-196a2CC genotypes compared with control subjects. miR-196a2CC, miR-146aCC/miR-196a2CC, and miR-149TT/miR-196a2CC in fetuses are possible risk factors for spontaneous abortion.
