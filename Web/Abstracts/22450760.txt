Pri-miR-17-92a transcript folds into a tertiary structure and autoregulates its processing. MicroRNAs control gene expression either by RNA transcript degradation or translational repression. Expressions of miRNAs are highly regulated in tissues, disruption of which leads to disease. How this regulation is achieved and maintained is still largely unknown. MiRNAs that reside on clustered or polycistronic transcripts represent a more complex case where individual miRNAs from a cluster are processed with different efficiencies despite being cotranscribed. To shed light on the regulatory mechanisms that might be operating in these cases, we considered the long polycistronic primary miRNA transcript pri-miR-17-92a that contains six miRNAs with diverse functions. The six miRNA domains on this cluster are differentially processed to produce varying amounts of resultant mature miRNAs in different tissues. How this is achieved is not known. We show, using various biochemical and biophysical methods coupled with mutational studies, that pri-miR-17-92a adopts a specific three-dimensional architecture that poses a kinetic barrier to its own processing. This tertiary structure could create suboptimal protein recognition sites on the pri-miRNA cluster due to higher-order structure formation.
