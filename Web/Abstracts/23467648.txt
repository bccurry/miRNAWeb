MiR-134 regulates the proliferation and invasion of glioblastoma cells by reducing Nanog expression. MiR-134 is a brain-enriched miRNA that plays an essential role in the development of the embryonic stem cell-orientated differentiation to central nervous system by suppression of Nanog and neural development (including neurons, cylindraxile and dendrites) and has been shown to be downregulated in oligodendrogliomas (ODG) and glioblastomas (GBM), suggesting its possible involvement in brain tumor progression. In this study, we defined the expression and function of miR-134, which we found to be downregulated in glioma samples and the glioblastoma cell line U87 by SYBR green real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (real-time PCR). Early reports have characterized Nanog as a direct target of miR-134 by a dual-luciferase reporter assay in 293T cells. In our study, overexpression of miR-134 in U87 glioblastoma cells resulted in significant downregulation of Nanog mRNA levels as well as protein levels. miR-134 overexpression reduced the proliferation, invasiveness and migration capability of U87 cells while promoted apoptosis of these cells in vitro and suppressed the growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. These findings demonstrated that miR-134 deregulation is common in human gliomas. Restoration of its function inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and migration capability and promotes apoptosis, which could be partly due to its inhibitory effect on Nanog protein expression in glioblastoma cells. MiR-134 could play an important role as a tumor suppressor relying on its direct translational attenuation of Nanog.
