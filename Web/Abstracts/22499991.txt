Downregulation of endothelial microRNA-200b supports cutaneous wound angiogenesis by desilencing GATA binding protein 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate angiogenesis by posttranscriptional silencing of target genes. The significance of angiostatic miR-200b in switching on skin wound angiogenesis was tested. Wounding caused imminent and transient downregulation of miR-200b in dermal wound-edge endothelial cells. Derailing this injury response by lentiviral delivery of miR-200b in vivo impaired wound angiogenesis. Computational prediction, target reporter luciferase assay, and Western blot analysis provided first evidence that miR-200b targets globin transcription factor binding protein 2 (GATA2) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Overexpression of GATA2 or VEGFR2 in endothelial cells rescued the angiostatic effect of miR-200b in vitro. Downregulation of miR-200b derepressed GATA2 and VEGFR2 expression to switch on wound angiogenesis, which was disrupted in diabetic wounds. Treatment of endothelial cells with tumor necrosis factor-, a proinflammatory cytokine abundant in diabetic wounds, induced miR-200b expression, silenced GATA2 and VEGFR2, and suppressed angiogenesis. These outcomes were attenuated using anti-miR-200b strategy. Neutralization of tumor necrosis factor- in the diabetic wounds improved wound angiogenesis and closure, which was accompanied by downregulation of miR-200b expression and desilencing of GATA2 and VEGFR2. Injury-induced repression of miR-200b turned on wound angiogenesis. In mice with diabetes mellitus,excessive tumor necrosis factor- induced miR-200b blunting proangiogenic functions of GATA2 and VEGFR2.
