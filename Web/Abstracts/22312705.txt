MiR-122 increases sensitivity of drug-resistant BEL-7402/5-FU cells to 5-fluorouracil via down-regulation of bcl-2 family proteins. To investigate the changes in drug sensitivity of miR-122 transfected BEL-7402/5-FU cells. MiR-122 and negative miRNA expression vectors were constructed and stably transfected into BEL-7402/5-FU cells. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the level of miR-122, Bcl-XL, Bcl-2 and P53 mRNA. Western Blotting was used to detect Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and P53 protein expression. Drug sensitivity of the cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was analyzed with MTT and flow cytometry. Compared with negative miRNA transfectants or untreated cells, mRNA and protein expression level of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL in stable miR-122 transfectants were decreased. Accordingly, P53 protein expression showed a significant up-regulation; MTT results showed that after incubation with 5-FU, miR-122 transfectants had higher cell inhibitory rates than negative miRNA or untreated cells; flow cytometry results demonstrated that apoptosis rate increased in miR-122 transfected cells, compared with negative miRNA or untreated cells. After addition of 5-FU (10 and 100 micromol/I), miR-122 transfected cells showed higher apoptosis rate than negative miRNA or untreated cells. MiR-122 can specifically down-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and increase P53 activity in BEL-7402/5-FU cells, which increased cells spontaneous apoptosis and sensitize cells to 5-FU. Therefore, MiR-122 can be used as a potential therapy agent against human hepatoblastoma.
