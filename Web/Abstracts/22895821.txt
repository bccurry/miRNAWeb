A predicted miR-27a-mediated network identifies a signature of glioma. The dysregulation of physiological microRNA (miRNA) activity has been shown to play an important role in gliomagenesis. In a previous study, using microRNA arrays and glioma tissues found that miR-27a was upregulated, which was also identified in the glioma cell lines and samples by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In this study, in order to explore the potential roles of miR-27a in the progression of glioma, we first utilized text-mining of PubMed abstracts with natural language processing (NLP) to identify 1,168 glioma-related molecules. In addition, miR-27a targets predicted by computational methods were integrated with the results from NLP analysis, followed by Gene Ontology (GO), pathway and network analysis. We identified 33hub genes by overlap calculation and demonstrated that miR-27a may be involved in the progression of glioma through adherens junction, focal adhesion, the neurotrophin signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, the transforming growth factor- (TGF-) signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, the p53 signaling pathway, the apoptotic signaling pathway, as well as others. Our data may provide researchers with a better understanding of the mechanisms of the miR-27a-target network in glioma initiation and progression.
