MicroRNA-29c enhances the sensitivities of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This study was aimed to investigate the potential role of microRNA-29c (miR-29c) in regulating the sensitivities of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) to ionizing radiation (IR) and cisplatin. Low expression of miR-29c was positively associated with therapeutic resistance in 159 NPC cases. Our further in vitro and in vivo studies illustrated ectopic restoration of miR-29c substantially enhanced the sensitivity of NPC cells to IR and cisplatin treatment by promoting apoptosis. Furthermore, we detected miR-29c repressed expression of anti-apoptotic factors, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in NPC tissues and cell lines. These data indicate miR-29c might serve as a potential therapeutic sensitizer in NPC treatment.
