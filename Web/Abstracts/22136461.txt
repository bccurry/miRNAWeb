Cardiovascular importance of the microRNA-23/27/24 family. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of highly conserved, noncoding short RNA molecules that regulate gene expression on the post-transcriptional level. MiRNAs are involved in a variety of processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Deregulated expression of miRNAs has been linked to the development of diseases including cardiovascular disorders. Recently, the miR-23/27/24 cluster has been shown to be involved in angiogenesis and endothelial apoptosis in cardiac ischemia and retinal vascular development. In the present review, we summarize and discuss the role and importance of the miRNA-23/27/24 cluster during cardiovascular angiogenesis. Moreover, we illustrate a novel therapeutic application of the miRNA-23/27/24 cluster in vascular disorders and ischemic heart disease.
