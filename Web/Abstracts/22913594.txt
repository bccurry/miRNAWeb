Developing microRNA therapeutics: approaching the unique complexities. MicroRNAs are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by interfering with translation or stability of target transcripts. The importance of microRNAs for maintaining biological functions is illustrated by the fact that microRNAs are exploited in nature to regulate phenotypes, and by the diverse disease phenotypes that result when microRNAs are mutated or improperly expressed. Disease-associated microRNAs might therefore represent a new class of therapeutic targets. With the recent demonstration that inhibition of miR-122 reduces viral load in hepatitis C patients, microRNA modulators are no longer merely theoretical, but rather, have become strong candidate therapeutics. The complexity of microRNA biology offers a novel mechanism of action for therapeutic intervention but also poses unique challenges for the development of therapeutic modulators as drugs.
