Reduction of miR-21 induces glioma cell apoptosis via activating caspase 9 and 3. Extensive data indicate that miR-21 plays a critical role in gliomagenesis, however, knowledge is limited on the mechanism of action of miR-21, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. In this study, we showed that down-regulation of miR-21 expression by antisense oligonucleotides inhibited glioma cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, reduction of miR-21 activated caspase 9 and 3, which may be mediated by modulating multiple potential target genes, such as TIMP3. Together, these findings indicate that miR-21 plays a key role in regulating cell apoptosis in gliomas and may serve as a target for effective therapies.
