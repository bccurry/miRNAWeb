Correlation between microRNA expression levels and clinical parameters associated with chronic hepatitis C viral infection in humans. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate gene expression pathways. Previous studies have shown interactions between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and host miRNAs. We measured miR-122 and miR-21 levels in HCV-infected human liver biopsies relative to uninfected human livers and correlated these with clinical patient data. miR-122 is required for HCV replication in vitro, and miR-21 is involved in cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. We found that miR-21 expression correlated with viral load, fibrosis and serum liver transaminase levels. miR-122 expression inversely correlated with fibrosis, liver transaminase levels and patient age. miR-21 was induced twofold, and miR-122 was downregulated on infection of cultured cells with the HCV J6/JFH infectious clone, thus establishing a link to HCV. To further examine the relationship between fibrosis and the levels of miR-21 and miR-122, we measured their expression levels in a mouse carbon tetrachloride fibrosis model. As in the HCV-infected patient samples, fibrotic stage positively correlated with miR-21 and negatively correlated with miR-122 levels. Transforming growth factor  (TGF-) is a critical mediator of fibrogenesis. We identified SMAD7 as a novel miR-21 target. SMAD7 is a negative regulator of TGF- signaling, and its expression is induced by TGF-. To confirm the relationship between miR-21 and the TGF- signaling pathway, we measured the effect of miR-21 on a TGF--responsive reporter. We found that miR-21 enhanced TGF- signaling, further supporting a relationship between miR-21 and fibrosis. We suggest a model in which miR-21 targeting of SMAD7 could increase TGF- signaling, leading to increased fibrogenesis.
