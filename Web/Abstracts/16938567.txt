Overlapping 3q28 amplifications in the COMA cell line and undifferentiated primary sarcoma. Historically, amplicon mapping and characterization of double minute (dmin) chromosomes content have been the ways to pinpoint important oncogenes. The COMA cell line established from a sarcoma contains DMs, some of them composed of material of the long arm of chromosome 3. To identify putative oncogenes on 3q that may be included in these dmins, we have analyzed the COMA cell line by microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH). We have detected the amplification of 1-Mb segment at 3q28, which contains the genes LPP, FLJ42393, and hsa-mir-28. Fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments confirmed the presence of numerous copies of 3q28 segment included in dmins. Further screening of eight undifferentiated primary sarcomas with 3q gains previously detected by chromosome CGH disclosed, in two cases, amplifications at 3q28 overlapping the 1-Mb segment amplified in COMA. To isolate target genes upregulated by gene dosage effect, we measured the transcription levels of every gene (in the RefSeq collection) located in the common region of amplification, selected expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and the micro-RNA hsa-mir-28 in the COMA cell line compared to one MFH cell line without alteration at 3q28. Expression levels of all transcripts were almost similar in both cell lines, except for two ESTs (AI338598 and BX118304) showing a 20-fold increase. These two transcripts are poorly characterized and their contribution to MFH carcinogenesis is difficult to evaluate.
