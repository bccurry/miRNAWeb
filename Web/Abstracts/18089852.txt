MicroRNA expression profiling in classic Hodgkin lymphoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are negative regulators of gene expression that play an important role in hematopoiesis and tumorigenesis. We analyzed miRNA expression in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and the influence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection on the miRNA expression profiles. The expression of 157 miRNAs in lymph nodes from 49 cHL patients and 10 reactive lymph nodes (RLNs) was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Hierarchic clustering revealed 3 well-defined groups: nodular sclerosis cHL, mixed cellularity cHL, and RLNs. A distinctive signature of 25 miRNAs differentiated cHL from RLNs, and 36 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity subtypes. These results were validated in a set of 30 cHLs and 5 RLNs, and in 3 cHL cell lines. miR-96, miR-128a, and miR-128b were selectively down-regulated in cHL with EBV. Our findings suggest that miRNAs play an important role in the biology of cHL and may be useful in developing therapies targeting miRNAs.
