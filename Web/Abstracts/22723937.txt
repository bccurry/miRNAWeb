MiR-137 targets estrogen-related receptor alpha and impairs the proliferative and migratory capacity of breast cancer cells. ERR is an orphan nuclear receptor emerging as a novel biomarker of breast cancer. Over-expression of ERR in breast tumor is considered as a prognostic factor of poor clinical outcome. The mechanisms underlying the dysexpression of this nuclear receptor, however, are poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play important roles in tumor initiation and progression. In the present study, we have identified that the expression of ERR is regulated by miR-137, a potential tumor suppressor microRNA. The bioinformatics search revealed two putative and highly conserved target-sites for miR-137 located within the ERR 3'UTR at nt 480-486 and nt 596-602 respectively. Luciferase-reporter assay demonstrated that the two predicted target sites were authentically functional. They mediated the repression of reporter gene expression induced by miR-137 in an additive manner. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-137 down-regulated ERR expression at both protein level and mRNA level, and the miR-137 induced ERR-knockdown contributed to the impaired proliferative and migratory capacity of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, transfection with miR-137 mimics suppressed at least two downstream target genes of ERR-CCNE1 and WNT11, which are important effectors of ERR implicated in tumor proliferation and migration. Taken together, our results establish a role of miR-137 in negatively regulating ERR expression and breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. They suggest that manipulating the expression level of ERR by microRNAs has the potential to influence breast cancer progression.
