MicroRNA hsa-miR-135b regulates mineralization in osteogenic differentiation of human unrestricted somatic stem cells. Unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) have been recently identified in human umbilical cord blood and have been shown to differentiate into lineages representing all 3 germ layers. To characterize microRNAs that may regulate osteogenic differentiation of USSCs, we carried out expression analysis for 157 microRNAs using quantitative RT-PCR before and after osteogenic induction (t = 0.5, 24, 72, 168, 216 h). Three microRNAs, hsa-miR-135b, hsa-miR-224, and hsa-miR-31, were consistently down-regulated during osteogenesis of USSC line 1. Hsa-miR-135b was shown to be the most profoundly down-regulated in osteogenesis of USSC line 1 and further confirmed to be down-regulated in the osteogenic differentiation of 2 additional USSC lines. Function of hsa-miR-135b in osteogenesis of USSCs was examined by retroviral overexpression, which resulted in an evident decreased mineralization, indicating that hsa-miR-135b down-regulation is functionally important for full osteogenic differentiation of USSCs. MicroRNAs have been shown to regulate negatively expression of their target gene(s). To identify putative targets of hsa-miR-135b, we performed cDNA microarray expression analysis. We selected in total 10 transcripts that were down-regulated (&gt;or=2-fold) in response to hsa-miR-135b overexpression at day 7 and day 9 of osteogenic differentiation. The function of most of these targets in human osteogenesis is unknown and requires further investigation. Markedly, quantitative RT-PCR data showed decreased expression of osteogenic markers IBSP and Osterix, both known to be involved in bone mineralization, in osteogenesis of USSCs that overexpress hsa-miR-135b. This finding suggests that hsa-miR-135b may control osteoblastic differentiation of USSCs by regulating expression of bone-related genes.
