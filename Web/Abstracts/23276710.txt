MicroRNA-143 functions as a tumor suppressor in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide with a poor prognosis. MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are a class of naturally occurring small noncoding RNAs and play an important role in cancer initiation and development. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression levels of miR-143 and miR-145 were significantly decreased in ESCC tissues in comparison with adjacent normal esophageal squamous tissues(NESTs). Furthermore, an inverse correlation between miR-143 and tumor invasion depth and lymph node metastasis was observed. The enforced expression of miR-143 induced growth suppression and apoptosis of ESCC cells. Rescue of miR-143 significantly suppressed the ESCC cells migration and invasion capabilities. Moreover, we show that functions of miR-143 in ESCC are mediated at least in part by the inhibition of extracellular signal regulated kinase-5(ERK-5) activity. These results prove that miR-143 may act as a tumor suppressor in ESCC.
