MicroRNA-100 regulates osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells by targeting BMPR2. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms governing human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) osteogenic differentiation is of great importance for improving the treatment of bone-related diseases. In this study, we examined the role of microRNA (miR)-100 on the osteogenesis of hASCs. Overexpression of miR-100 inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hASCs in vitro, whereas downregulation of miR-100 enhanced the process. Target prediction analysis and dual luciferase report assay confirmed that bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2) was a direct target of miR-100. Furthermore, knockdown of BMPR2 by RNA interference inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hASCs, similar as the effect of upregulation miR-100. Taken together, our findings imply that miR-100 plays a negative role in osteogenic differentiation and might act through targeting BMPR2.
