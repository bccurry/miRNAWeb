MicroRNA-217 promotes ethanol-induced fat accumulation in hepatocytes by down-regulating SIRT1. Ethanol-mediated inhibition of hepatic sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver disease. Here, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of this inhibition by identifying a new hepatic target of ethanol action, microRNA-217 (miR-217). The role of miR-217 in the regulation of the effects of ethanol was investigated in cultured mouse AML-12 hepatocytes and in the livers of chronically ethanol-fed mice. In AML-12 hepatocytes and in mouse livers, chronic ethanol exposure drastically and specifically induced miR-217 levels and caused excess fat accumulation. Further studies revealed that overexpression of miR-217 in AML-12 cells promoted ethanol-mediated impairments of SIRT1 and SIRT1-regulated genes encoding lipogenic or fatty acid oxidation enzymes. More importantly, miR-217 impairs functions of lipin-1, a vital lipid regulator, in hepatocytes. Taken together, our novel findings suggest that miR-217 is a specific target of ethanol action in the liver and may present as a potential therapeutic target for treating human alcoholic fatty liver disease.
