miR-200c is upregulated by oxidative stress and induces endothelial cell apoptosis and senescence via ZEB1 inhibition. We examined the effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on MicroRNAs (miRNAs) expression in endothelial cells in vitro, and in mouse skeletal muscle following acute hindlimb ischemia. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were exposed to 200M hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for 8 to 24h; miRNAs profiling showed that miR-200c and the co-transcribed miR-141 increased more than eightfold. The other miR-200 gene family members were also induced, albeit to a lower level. Furthermore, miR-200c upregulation was not endothelium restricted, and occurred also on exposure to an oxidative stress-inducing drug: 1,3-bis(2 chloroethyl)-1nitrosourea (BCNU). miR-200c overexpression induced HUVEC growth arrest, apoptosis and senescence; these phenomena were also induced by H(2)O(2) and were partially rescued by miR-200c inhibition. Moreover, miR-200c target ZEB1 messenger RNA and protein were downmodulated by H(2)O(2) and by miR-200c overexpression. ZEB1 knockdown recapitulated miR-200c-induced responses, and expression of a ZEB1 allele non-targeted by miR-200c, prevented miR-200c phenotype. The mechanism of H(2)O(2)-mediated miR-200c upregulation involves p53 and retinoblastoma proteins. Acute hindlimb ischemia enhanced miR-200c in wild-type mice skeletal muscle, whereas in p66(ShcA -/-) mice, which display lower levels of oxidative stress after ischemia, upregulation of miR-200c was markedly inhibited. In conclusion, ROS induce miR-200c and other miR-200 family members; the ensuing downmodulation of ZEB1 has a key role in ROS-induced apoptosis and senescence.
