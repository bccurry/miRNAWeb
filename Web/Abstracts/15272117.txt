RNA editing of a miRNA precursor. Micro RNAs comprise a large family of small, functional RNAs with important roles in the regulation of protein coding genes in animals and plants. Here we show that human and mouse miRNA22 precursor molecules are subject to posttranscriptional modification by A-to-I RNA editing in vivo. The observed editing events are predicted to have significant implications for the biogenesis and function of miRNA22 and might point toward a more general role for RNA editing in the regulation of miRNA gene expression.
