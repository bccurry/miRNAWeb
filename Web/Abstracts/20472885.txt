miR-182 as a prognostic marker for glioma progression and patient survival. Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNA expression can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for human cancers. We report that the expression level of miR-182 was markedly up-regulated in glioma cell lines and in human primary glioma specimens. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that miR-182 was significantly increased by up to 32-fold in glioma tumors compared with the adjacent nontumor brain tissues obtained from the same patient. Elevated expression of miR-182 was further identified by in situ hybridization in 248 of 253 (98%) archived human glioma biopsies tested. Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between miR-182 expression and World Health Organization glioma grading (P &lt; 0.001). The cumulative 5-year survival rate of glioma patients was 51.54% (95% confidence interval, 0.435 to 0.596) in the low miR-182-expression group, whereas it was only 7.23% (95% confidence interval, 0.027 to 0.118) in the high miR-182-expression group (P = 0.001), and multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miR-182 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for the survival of glioma patients. Moreover, the correlations of miR-182 level with the clinical features of glioma suggested in the in situ hybridization analysis were further verified by the real-time RT-PCR analysis. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-182 could be a valuable marker of glioma progression and that high miR-182 expression is associated with poor overall survival in patients with malignant glioma.
