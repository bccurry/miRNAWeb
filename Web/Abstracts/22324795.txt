Analysis of chromosome 19q13.42 amplification in embryonal brain tumors with ependymoblastic multilayered rosettes. Recently, it was reported that ependymoblastoma and embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR) show 19q13.42 amplification at a high frequency, suggesting that these tumors may constitute a single entity. As ependymoblastic rosettes are the most prominent features in both subtypes, embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) was proposed, for which 19q13.42 amplification represents a specific molecular hallmark. However, ependymoblastic rosettes are not specific to ependymoblastoma and ETANTR, and are also found in a few other embryonal tumors as well as immature teratomas, and knowledge on 19q13.42 amplification in these tumors is limited. In this study, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridazation (FISH) analysis and differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and detected 19q13.42 amplification in three out of four ETANTR, one ependymoblastoma and one medulloepithelioma with ETANTR components, whereas none of the two atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) with ependymoblastic rosettes nor two immature teratomas with developing neuroectodermal structures showed such amplification, suggesting that medulloepitheliomas would possibly be included in ETMR, and ependymoblastic rosettes in AT/RT do not signify that these tumors constitute ETMR. Also, we found C19MC rather than miR-371-373 was amplified in one ETANTR, suggesting that C19MC miRNA cluster seems to be more closely linked to the pathogenesis of ETMR.
