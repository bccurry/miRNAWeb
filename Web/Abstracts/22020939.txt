Cysteine-rich 61-connective tissue growth factor-nephroblastoma-overexpressed 5 (CCN5)/Wnt-1-induced signaling protein-2 (WISP-2) regulates microRNA-10b via hypoxia-inducible factor-1-TWIST signaling networks in human breast cancer cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are naturally occurring single-stranded RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of target mRNA transcripts. Many of these target mRNA transcripts are involved in regulating processes commonly altered during tumorigenesis and metastatic growth. These include cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Among the several miRNAs, miRNA-10b (miR-10b) expression is increased in metastatic breast cancer cells and positively regulates cell migration and invasion through the suppression of the homeobox D10 (HOXD10) tumor suppressor signaling pathway. In breast metastatic cells, miR-10b expression is enhanced by a transcription factor TWIST1. We find that miR-10b expression in breast cancer cells can be suppressed by CCN5, and this CCN5 effect is mediated through the inhibition of TWIST1 expression. Moreover, CCN5-induced inhibition of TWIST1 expression is mediated through the translational inhibition/modification of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 via impeding JNK signaling pathway. Collectively, these studies suggest a novel regulatory pathway exists through which CCN5 exerts its anti-invasive function. On the basis of these findings, it is plausible that reactivation of CCN5 in miR-10b-positive invasive/metastatic breast cancers alone or in combination with current therapeutic regimens could provide a unique, alternative strategy to existing breast cancer therapy.
