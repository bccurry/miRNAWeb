The microRNA-200 family regulates epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is implicated in metastasis initiation and has recently been shown to be regulated by the miRNA-200 family and miR-205. Expression of these miRNAs was lost in invasive breast cancer cell lines displaying mesenchymal-like morphology suggesting these microRNAs may play a role in cancer metastasis.
