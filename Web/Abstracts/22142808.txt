Increased accumulation of extracellular thrombospondin-2 due to low degradation activity stimulates type I collagen expression in scleroderma fibroblasts. The aim of the present study was to determine the expression and role of thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2) in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Both TSP-2 mRNA levels and protein synthesis in cell lysates were significantly lower in cultured SSc fibroblasts than in normal fibroblasts; however, the TSP-2 protein that accumulated in the conditioned medium of SSc fibroblasts was up-regulated, compared with that of normal fibroblasts, because of an increase in the half-life of the protein. In vivo serum TSP-2 levels were higher in SSc patients than in healthy control subjects, and SSc patients with elevated serum TSP-2 levels tended to have pitting scars and/or ulcers. TSP-2 knockdown resulted in the down-regulation of type I collagen expression and the up-regulation of miR-7, one of the miRNAs with an inhibitory effect on collagen expression. Expression levels of miR-7 were also up-regulated in SSc dermal fibroblasts both in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased extracellular TSP-2 deposition in SSc fibroblasts may contribute to tissue fibrosis by inducing collagen expression. Down-regulation of intracellular TSP-2 synthesis and the subsequent miR-7 up-regulation in SSc fibroblasts may be due to a negative feedback mechanism that prevents increased extracellular TSP-2 deposition and/or tissue fibrosis. Thus, TSP-2 may play an important role in the maintenance of fibrosis and angiopathy in patients with SSc.
