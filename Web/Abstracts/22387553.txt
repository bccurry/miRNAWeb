Downregulation of inflammatory microRNAs by Ig-like transcript 3 is essential for the differentiation of human CD8(+) T suppressor cells. We have investigated the mechanism underlying the immunoregulatory function of membrane Ig-like transcript 3 (ILT3) and soluble ILT3Fc. microRNA (miRNA) expression profile identified genes that were downregulated in ILT3-induced human CD8(+) T suppressor cells (Ts) while upregulated in T cells primed in the absence of ILT3. We found that miR-21, miR-30b, and miR-155 target the 3'-untranslated region of genes whose expression was strongly increased in ILT3Fc-induced Ts, such as dual specificity phosphatase 10, B cell CLL/lymphoma 6, and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, respectively. Transfection of miRNA mimics or inhibitors and site-specific mutagenesis of their 3'-untranslated region binding sites indicated that B cell CLL/lymphoma 6, dual specificity phosphatase 10, and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 are direct targets of miR-30b, miR-21, and miR-155. Primed CD8(+) T cells transfected with miR-21&amp;30b, miR-21&amp;155, or miR-21&amp;30b&amp;155 inhibitors displayed suppressor activity when added to autologous CD3-triggered CD4 T cells. Luciferase reporter assays of miR-21 and miR-155 indicated that their transcription is highly dependent on AP-1. Analysis of activated T cells showed that ILT3Fc inhibited the translocation to the nucleus of the AP-1 subunits, FOSB and c-FOS, and the phosphorylation of ZAP70 and phospholipase C- 1. In conclusion, ILT3Fc inhibits T cell activation and induces the generation of Ts targeting multiple inflammatory miRNA pathways.
