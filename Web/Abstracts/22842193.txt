High expression of miR-210 predicts poor survival in patients with breast cancer: a meta-analysis. Many microRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit altered expression levels in cancers, and they may be considered as valuable prognostic biomarkers for cancers. Here we aimed to summarize the recent advances in miR-210 involvement in human breast cancer and analyze the predicting role of miR-210 for survival. A meta-analysis was performed by searching PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Science Direct databases. Data were extracted from studies comparing survival in patients with breast cancer having higher expression of miR-210 with those having lower expression. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. A total of 511 cases of breast cancer were involved for this global meta-analysis. For post-operational survival, the HR of higher miR-210 expression in breast cancer tissue was 3.39 (95% CI: 2.04-5.63, P&lt;0.05), which could significantly predict poorer survival. High expression of miR-210 might predict poor survival in patients with breast cancer.
