miR-19a and miR-19b Overexpression in Gliomas. Astrocytic gliomas are the most common type of human primary brain tumors with poor prognosis. MicroRNAs(miRs) are frequently deregulated in gliomas and play an oncogenic or tumor suppressor role. In our previous study we found that miR-19a and miR-19b were up-regulated in malignant glioma cell lines by microRNA array. For further validation of this finding, the expression of miR-19a and miR-19b was detected by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization(ISH) in 8 malignant glioma cell lines, 43 freshly resected glioma samples and 75 archival paraffin embedded glioma specimens with different grades of malignancy in the present study. The results demonstrate that miR-19a and miR-19b are overexpressed in glioma cell lines and astrocytic glioma tissues, and their expression level is positively correlated with tumor grades. Additionally, the tumor suppressor gene PTEN is identified as the target of miR-19a and miR-19b by Luciferase assay. It is speculated that miR-19a and miR-19b may have an oncogenic role in gliomagenesis at least partially via the negative regulation of PTEN and the molecular mechanism of gliomagenesis in which miR 19a and miR-19b involved should be investigated further.
