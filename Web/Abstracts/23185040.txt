The microRNA-302-367 cluster suppresses the proliferation of cervical carcinoma cells through the novel target AKT1. The miR-302-367 cluster is specifically expressed in human embryonic stem cells and has been shown to convert human somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, we investigated the role of the miR-302-367 cluster in cervical carcinoma. The cluster was not endogenously expressed in cervical cancer cells, and its ectopic expression did not reprogram the cervical cancer cells to an embryonic stem cell-like state. However, ectopic expression of the miR-302-367 cluster in HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation and tumor formation by blocking the G1/S cell cycle transition. We identified a new cell cycle regulatory pathway in which the miR-302-367 cluster directly down-regulated both cyclin D1 and AKT1 and indirectly up-regulated p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1), leading to the suppression of cervical cancer cell proliferation. Our findings suggest that the miR-302-367 cluster may be used as a therapeutic reagent for the treatment of cervical carcinoma.
