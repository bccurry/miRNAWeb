Significance of dysregulated metadherin and microRNA-375 in head and neck cancer. Despite recent improvements in local control of head and neck cancers (HNC), distant metastasis remains a major cause of death. Hence, further understanding of HNC biology, and in particular, the genes/pathways driving metastasis is essential to improve outcome. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of miR-375 and metadherin (MTDH) in HNC patient samples. Targets of miR-375 were confirmed using qRT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and luciferase assays. Phenotypic effects of miR-375 reexpression and MTDH knockdown were assessed using viability (MTS), clonogenic survival, cell migration/invasion, as well as in vivo tumor formation assays. The prognostic significance of miR-375 or MTDH in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) was determined by comparing low versus high expression groups. MiR-375 expression was significantly reduced (P = 0.01), and conversely, MTDH was significantly increased (P = 0.0001) in NPC samples. qRT-PCR, Western blots, and luciferase assays corroborated MTDH as a target of miR-375. Reexpression of miR-375 and siRNA knockdown of MTDH both decreased cell viability and clonogenic survival, cell migration/invasion, as well as in vivo tumor formation. NPC patients whose tumors expressed high levels of MTDH experienced significantly lower survival and, in particular, higher distant relapse rates (5-year distant relapse rates: 26% vs. 5%; P = 0.005). Dysregulation of miR-375 and MTDH may represent an important oncogenic pathway driving human HNC progression, particularly distant metastases, which is now emerging as a major cause of death for HNC patients. Hence, targeting this pathway could potentially be a novel therapeutic strategy by which HNC patient outcome could be improved.
