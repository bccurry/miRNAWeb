miR-10a restores human mesenchymal stem cell differentiation by repressing KLF4. miRNAs have recently been shown to play a significant role in human aging. However, data demonstrating the effects of aging-related miRNAs in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are limited. We observed that hMSC differentiation decreased with aging. We also identified that miR-10a expression was significantly decreased with age by comparing the miRNA expression of hMSCs derived from young and aged individuals. Therefore, we hypothesized that the downregulation of miR-10a may be associated with the decreased differentiation capability of hMSCs from aged individuals. Lentiviral constructs were used to up- or downregulate miR-10a in young and old hMSCs. Upregulation of miR-10a resulted in increased differentiation to adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages and in reduced cell senescence. Conversely, downregulation of miR-10a resulted in decreased cell differentiation and increased cell senescence. A chimeric luciferase reporter system was generated, tagged with the full-length 3'-UTR region of KLF4 harboring the seed-matched sequence with or without four nucleotide mutations. These constructs were cotransfected with the miR-10a mimic into cells. The luciferase activity was significantly repressed by the miR-10a mimic, proving the direct binding of miR-10a to the 3'-UTR of KLF4. Direct suppression of KLF4 in aged hMSCs increased cell differentiation and decreased cell senescence. In conclusion, miR-10a restores the differentiation capability of aged hMSCs through repression of KLF4. Aging-related miRNAs may have broad applications in the restoration of cell dysfunction caused by aging. J. Cell. Physiol.  2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
