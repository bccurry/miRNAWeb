LNA-based oligonucleotide electrotransfer for miRNA inhibition. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that play an important role in disease development and progression and therefore represent a potential new class of therapeutic targets. However, an effective and safe clinical approach for miRNA inhibition remains elusive, primarily due to the lack of effective delivery methods. We proposed to inhibit miRNA by electrotransferring an antisense DNA oligomer containing locked nucleic acids (LNAs) (LNA/DNA oligomer). We observed that electropulsation (EP) led to a strong cellular uptake of LNA/DNA oligomer. The LNA/DNA oligomer electrotransfer mechanism and intracellular localization were visually investigated in real time at the single-cell level. Cyanine 5-labeled oligonucleotide entered exclusively during pulse application on the side of the permeabilized cell membrane facing the cathode, driven by electrophoretic forces. Minutes after the electrotransfer, the LNA/DNA oligomer diffused into the nucleus. EP provided the anti-miRNA oligomer with immediate and direct access to its cytoplasmic mature miRNA target and/or its nuclear precursor miRNA target. We then demonstrated using a LNA/DNA oligomer anti-miR34a that LNA/DNA oligomer electrotransfer decreased the level of the miR34a target and induced its functional inhibition. Our findings show that using the electrotransfer technique for LNA-based oligonucleotide delivery is a promising therapeutic strategy to silence deleterious miRNAs overexpressed in diseases.
