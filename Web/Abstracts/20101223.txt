Multiple microRNAs rescue from Ras-induced senescence by inhibiting p21(Waf1/Cip1). Overexpression of Ras(G12V) in primary cells induces a permanent growth arrest called oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) that serves as a fail-safe mechanism against malignant transformation. We have performed a genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen and a microRNA (miRNA) screen to identify mediators of OIS and show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of p21(Waf1/Cip1) rescues from Ras(G12V)-induced senescence in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). Moreover, we isolated a total of 28 miRNAs that prevented Ras(G12V)-induced growth arrest, among which all of the miR-106b family members were present. In addition, we obtained a number of hits, miR-130b, miR-302a, miR-302b, miR302c, miR-302d, miR-512-3p and miR-515-3p with seed sequences very similar to miR-106b family members. We show that overexpression of all these miRNAs rescues HMECs from Ras(G12V)-induced senescence by prevention of Ras(G12V)-induced upregulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1). Our results establish an important role for the cell cycle inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1) in growth control of HMECs and extend the repertoire of miRNAs that modulate the activity of this tumour suppressor.
