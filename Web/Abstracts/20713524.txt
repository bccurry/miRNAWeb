miR-335 directly targets Rb1 (pRb/p105) in a proximal connection to p53-dependent stress response. Loss-of-function mutations of retinoblastoma family (Rb) proteins drive tumorigenesis by overcoming barriers to cellular proliferation. Consequently, factors modulating Rb function are of great clinical import. Here, we show that miR-335 is differentially expressed in human cancer cells and that it tightly regulates the expression of Rb1 (pRb/p105) by specifically targeting a conserved sequence motif in its 3' untranslated region. We found that by altering Rb1 (pRb/p105) levels, miR-335 activates the p53 tumor suppressor pathway to limit cell proliferation and neoplastic cell transformation. DNA damage elicited an increase in miR-335 expression in a p53-dependent manner. miR-335 and p53 cooperated in a positive feedback loop to drive cell cycle arrest. Together, these results indicate that miR-335 helps control proliferation by balancing the activities of the Rb and p53 tumor suppressor pathways. Further, they establish that miR-335 activation plays an important role in the induction of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest after DNA damage.
