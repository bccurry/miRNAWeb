Cellular microRNAs inhibit replication of the H1N1 influenza A virus in infected cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs of lengths ranging from 18 to 23 nucleotides (nt) that play critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes. There is a growing amount of evidence that miRNAs play critical roles in intricate host-pathogen interaction networks, but the involvement of miRNAs during influenza viral infection is unknown. To determine whether the cellular miRNAs play an important role in H1N1 influenza A viral infections, 3' untranslated region (UTR) reporter analysis was used to identify putative miRNA targets in the influenza virus genome, and virus proliferation analysis was used to detect the effect of the screened miRNAs on the replication of H1N1 influenza A virus (A/WSN/33) in MDCK cells. The results showed that miRNA 323 (miR-323), miR-491, and miR-654 inhibit replication of the H1N1 influenza A virus through binding to the PB1 gene. Moreover mutational analysis of the predicted miRNA binding sites showed that the three miRNAs bind to the same conserved region of the PB1 gene. Intriguingly, despite the fact that the miRNAs and PB1 mRNA binding sequences are not a perfect match, the miRNAs downregulate PB1 expression through mRNA degradation instead of translation repression. This is the first demonstration that cellular miRNAs regulate influenza viral replication by degradation of the viral gene. Our findings support the notion that any miRNA has antiviral potential, independent of its cellular function, and that the cellular miRNAs play an important role in the host, defending against virus infection.
