Downregulation of CCND1 and CDK6 by miR-34a induces cell cycle arrest. miRNAs regulate gene expression by inhibiting translation or by targeting messenger RNA (mRNA) for degradation in a post-transcriptional fashion. In the present study, we show that ectopic expression of miR-34a reduces both mRNA and protein levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). We also demonstrate that miR-34a targets the 3'-untranslated mRNA region of CCND1 as well as CDK6, which in turn interferes with phosphorylation of retinoblastoma. In addition, we show that overexpression of miR-34a induces a significant G1 cell-cycle arrest in the A549 cell line. Taken together, our data suggest that the effects of miR-34a on G1 cell cycle arrest are through the down-regulation of CCND1 and CDK6, which is associated with other targets of miR-34a either additively or synergistically.
