Quantitative proteomics reveals that miR-155 regulates the PI3K-AKT pathway in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The aberrant expression of microRNA-155 (miR-155), which has emerged as having a significant impact on the biological characteristics of lymphocytes, plays important roles in B-cell malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is the most common non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the adult population, accounting for approximately 40% of newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases globally. To determine the specific function of miR-155, a quantitative proteomics approach was applied to examine the inhibitory effects of miR-155 on protein synthesis in DLBCL cells. PIK3R1 (p85), a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway, was identified as a direct target of miR-155. A luciferase reporter was repressed through the direct interaction of miR-155 and the p85 3'-untranslated region, and overexpression of miR-155 down-regulated both the transcription and translation of p85. The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was highly activated by the sustained overexpression of miR-155 in DHL16 cells, whereas knockdown of miR-155 in OCI-Ly3 cells diminished AKT activity. Taken together, our results reveal a novel target involved in miR-155 biological characteristics and provide a molecular link between the overexpression of miR-155 and the activation of PI3K-AKT in DLBCL.
