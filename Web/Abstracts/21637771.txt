Effects of common polymorphisms rs11614913 in miR-196a2 and rs2910164 in miR-146a on cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis. MicroRNAs regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and involved in diverse biological and pathological processes, including tumorigenesis. Rs11614913 in miR-196a2 and rs2910164 in miR-146a are shown to associate with increased/decreased cancer risk. We performed a meta-analysis to systematically summarize the possible association. We assessed published studies of the association between these microRNA polymorphisms and cancer risk from eleven studies with 16,771 subjects for miR-196a2 and from ten studies with 15,126 subjects for miR-146a. As for rs11614913, the contrast of homozygote (TT vs CC: OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.85-0.99, P(heterogeneity)=0.45), allele (T vs C: OR=0.96, 95% CI=0.92-0.99, P(heterogeneity)=0.61) and recessive model (OR=0.90, 95% CI=0.84-0.97, P(heterogeneity)=0.50) produced statistically association. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity, statistically significantly decreased cancer risks were found among Asians for allele contrast (OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.90-0.99, P(heterogeneity)=0.74) and the recessive genetic model (OR=0.90, 95% CI=0.82-0.98, P(heterogeneity)=0.85). According to subgroup analysis by tumor types, the protective effect of C/T polymorphism was only found in breast cancer under allele contrast (T vs C: OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.88-0.99, P(heterogeneity)=0.26). For rs2910164, no significant associations were found among overall analysis model with relatively large heterogeneity. Through the stratified analysis, heterogeneity decreased significantly. In the subgroup analyses by cancer types, the C allele of rs2910164 was associated with protection from digestive cancer in allele contrast (C vs G: OR=0.86, 95% CI=0.77-0.96, P(heterogeneity)=0.51). Our meta-analysis suggests that the rs11614913 most likely contributes to decreased susceptibility to cancer, especially in Asians and breast cancer. Besides, the C allele of the rs2910164 might be associated with a protection from digestive cancer.
