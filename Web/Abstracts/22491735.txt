Human microRNA-1245 downregulates the NKG2D receptor in NK cells and impairs NKG2D-mediated functions. Background. NKG2D is an activating receptor expressed by NK and T cells, which have crucial functions in tumor and microbial immunosurveillance. Several cytokines have been identified as modulators of NKG2D receptor expression. However, little is known about NKG2D gene regulation. In this study, we found that microRNA 1245 attenuated the expression of NKG2D in NK cells. Design and Methods. We investigated the potential interactions between the 3-untranslated region of NKG2D gene and microRNAs as well as their functional roles in the regulation of NKG2D expression and cytotoxicity in NK cells.Results. TGF-1, a major negative regulator of NKG2D expression, post-transcriptionally upregulated mature microRNA 1245 expression, thus downregulating NKG2D expression and impairing NKG2D-mediated immune responses in NK cells. Conversely, miR-1245 downregulation significantly augmented the expression of NKG2D expression in NK cells, resulting in more efficient NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity.Conclusions. These results reveal a novel NKG2D regulatory pathway mediated by microRNA 1245, which may represent one of the mechanisms used by TGF-1 to attenuate NKG2D expression in NK cells.
