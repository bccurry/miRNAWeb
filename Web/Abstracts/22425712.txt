Down-regulation of the microRNA-99 family members in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. MicroRNA deregulation is a critical event in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Several microRNA profiling studies aimed at deciphering the microRNA signatures of HNSCC have been reported, but there tends to be poor agreement among studies. The objective of this study was to survey the published microRNA profiling studies on HNSCC, and to assess the commonly deregulated microRNAs in an independent sample set. Meta-analysis of 13 published microRNA profiling studies was performed to define microRNA signatures in HNSCC. Selected microRNAs (including members of miR-99 family) were evaluated in an independent set of HNSCC cases. The potential contributions of miR-99 family to the tumorigenesis of HNSCC were assessed by in vitro assays. We identified 67 commonly deregulated microRNAs. The up-regulation of miR-21, miR-155, miR-130b, miR-223 and miR-31, and the down-regulation of miR-100, miR-99a and miR-375 were further validated in an independent set of HNSCC cases with quantitative RT-PCR. Among these validated microRNAs, miR-100 and miR-99a belong to the miR-99 family. Our in vitro study demonstrated that restoration of miR-100 to the HNSCC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation and migration, and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, ectopic transfection of miR-99 family members down-regulated the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) genes. In summary, we described a panel of frequently deregulated microRNAs in HNSCC, including members of miR-99 family. The deregulation of miR-99 family contributes to the tumorigenesis of HNSCC, in part by targeting IGF1R and mTOR signaling pathways.
