Aberrant microRNA expression in Chinese patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small endogenous RNAs that play important regulatory roles by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. Many reports have indicated that miRNAs play a critical role in malignancies, and regulations in the progression of leukemia. However, the miRNAs expression level in Chinese patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and its prognostic value remain elusive. We identified various degrees of down-regulation of miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-29b, miR-181a and miR-181b in CLL mononuclear cells. Moreover, we have identified miR-29b and miR-181a/b expression significantly correlated with IGHV mutational status. Transcript levels of predicted target genes BCL-2 and TCL-1 were also determined, and the expression levels were significantly upregulated in CLL patients compared with normal controls (P&lt;0.001). Higher expression of TCL-1 was significantly correlated with aggressive disease features. In addition, an inverse correlation was observed in the CLL samples we examined between miRNAs (miR-16-1, miR-181a, miR-181b) and BCL-2 level; furthermore, an inverse correlation was also observed between miRNAs (miR-16-1, miR-181a, miR-181b) and TCL-1, which suggest that these miRNAs may implicate in negatively regulating target mRNA at transcriptional level. These different miRNAs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CLL and might be applied for the assessment of prognosis in patients with CLL.
