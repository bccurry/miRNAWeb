Prognostic value of mature microRNA-21 and microRNA-205 overexpression in non-small cell lung cancer by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles are being intensively investigated for their involvement in carcinogenesis. We evaluated the prognostic value of mature microRNA-21 (miR-21) and mature microRNA-205 (miR-205) overexpression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We studied 48 pairs of NSCLC fresh frozen tissue specimens collected at time of surgery and before chemotherapy. Highly specific amplification and quantification of mature miR-21 and mature miR-205 was achieved using looped real time RT-PCR. miRNA expression, determined by real time RT-PCR, was defined by DeltaDeltaCt measurements. We detected overexpression of mature miR-21 in 25 (52.0%) of the 48 NSCLC paired specimens and overexpression of miR-205 in 31 (64.6%). Overexpression was assessed after comparison of miRNA expression in NSCLC tissues and in their corresponding noncancerous tissues with respect to U6 expression. During the follow-up period, 29 of 48 (60.4%) patients relapsed, and 23 of 48 died (47.9%). Mature miR-21 was upregulated in 16 of 29 (55.2%) patients who relapsed and 15 of 23 (65.2%) patients who died. Mature miR-205 was overexpressed in 19 of 29 patients who relapsed (65.5%) and 15 of 23 patients who died (65.2%). Mature miR-21 overexpression correlated with overall survival (OS) of the patients (P = 0.027), whereas overexpression of mature miR-205 did not. Our results suggest that overexpression of mature miR-21 is an independent negative prognostic factor for OS in NSCLC patients.
