The miR-200 and miR-221/222 microRNA families: opposing effects on epithelial identity. Carcinogenesis is a complex process during which cells undergo genetic and epigenetic alterations. These changes can lead tumor cells to acquire characteristics that enable movement from the primary site of origin when conditions become unfavorable. Such characteristics include gain of front-rear polarity, increased migration/invasion, and resistance to anoikis, which facilitate tumor survival during metastasis. An epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) constitutes one way that cancer cells can gain traits that promote tumor progression and metastasis. Two microRNA (miRNA) families, the miR-200 and miR-221 families, play crucial opposing roles that affect the differentiation state of breast cancers. These two families are differentially expressed between the luminal A subtype of breast cancer as compared to the less well-differentiated triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) that exhibit markers indicative of an EMT. The miR-200 family promotes a well-differentiated epithelial phenotype, while high miR-221/222 results in a poorly differentiated, mesenchymal-like phenotype. This review focuses on the mechanisms (specific proven targets) by which these two miRNA families exert opposing effects on cellular plasticity during breast tumorigenesis and metastasis.
