MiR-133a activates the p53/p21 pathway and functions as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer by repressing RFFL. Dysregulated miRNA in human colorectal cancer (CRC) were identified through comparison between 4 CRC tumors and their adjacent normal tissues by miRNA array. Hsa-miR-133a (miR-133a) was demonstrated to be significantly down-regulated in primary CRC tissues compared with the matched adjacent normal epithelial cells using laser capture micro-dissection. Ectopic expression of miR-133a significantly suppressed colon cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Cell cycle analysis revealed that miR-133a induced cells arrested at the G0/G1 phase, concomitant with the up-regulation of key G1 phase regulator p21. We further revealed that miR-133a markedly increased p53 protein and induced p21 transcription. Through in silico search, we found the 3'UTR of ring finger and FYVE-like domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (RFFL), an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase regulating p53 protein, contains an evolutionarily conserved miR-133a binding site. miR-133a repressed RFFL-3'UTR reporter activity and reduced RFFL protein level, indicating that miR-133a directly bound to RFFL mRNA and inhibited RFFL translation. Moreover, miR-133a sensitized colon cancer cells to doxorubicin and oxaliplatin by enhancing apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation, adding further weight to the potential significance of miR-133a as a tumor suppressor in inhibiting CRC. In conclusion, miR-133a serves as a functional tumor suppressor in CRC.
