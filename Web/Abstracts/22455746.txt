[MicroRNA expression and its role in the cell cycle regulation in decidualized endometrial stromal cells in vitro]. To study microRNA (miRNA) expression and role of cell cycle regulation in decidualized endometrial stormal cells (ESC) in vitro. ESC was induced decasualization in vitro and matched with non-decidualized cells as controls. The expression repertoire of miRNA was measured by microarray chip and was validated by real-time PCR. Flow cytometry was used to identify ESC cycle during decidual reaction in vitro and after miRNA222 inhibitor was transfected into it. (1) Between decidualized and undecidualized stromal cells, there were 49 miRNAs significantly different expression by microarray chip, including 16 miRNA up-regulation and 33 miRNA down-regulation.hsa-miR-27b, 30c, 143, 101, 181b, 29b, 30d, 507, 23a, 222, 221 exhibited significantly differential expression between decicualized and undecidualized stromal cells by real-time PCR (P &lt; 0.05). (2) After miRNA222 inhibitor (NC-FAM) transfection to decidual ESC, ESC were cultured by FBS medium for 24 hours, the rate of transfection was 70%. ESC were transfected with miRNA 222 inhibitor and cultured for 48 hours, the percentage of ESC at S-phase of (6.2  0.7)% were significantly lower than (10.9  0.8)% in control group (P &lt; 0.05);the percentage of ESC at G(0)/G(1) phase increased at transfection group [(77.5  1.3)% vs. (73.0  1.6)% at control group], but there was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). Decasualization ESC were transfected with miRNA 222 inhibitor and cultured for 48 h, the percentage of ESC at S-phase was (3.3  0.6)% in transfection group, which were significantly lower than (7.8  0.9)% in control group (P &lt; 0.05). The percentage of ESC at G(0)/G(1) phase was (80.7  1.6)% in transfection group and (74.9  1.1)%. In control group, which did not reached statistical difference (P &gt; 0.05). miRNA was involved in ESC decidual process in vitro by regulating cell cycle.
