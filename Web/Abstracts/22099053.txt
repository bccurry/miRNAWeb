Differential miRNA expression in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and association with clinical and biological features. The present study aimed to analyze the expression profile of the microRNAs previously described as associated with childhood ALL, miR-92a, miR-100, miR-125a-5p, miR-128a, miR-181b, miR-196b and let-7e, and their association with biological/prognostic features in 128 consecutive samples of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by quantitative real-time PCR. A significant association was observed between higher expression levels of miR-196b and T-ALL, miR-100 and patients with low white blood cell count at diagnosis and t(12;21) positive ALL. These findings suggest a potential activity of these microRNAs in pediatric ALL biology.
