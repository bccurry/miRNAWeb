Circulating miRNA as novel markers for diastolic dysfunction. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Though their significance is unclear, pioneer profiling studies have attributed specific serum miRNA signatures to different disease conditions. The diagnostic potential of miRNA detection in human plasma for cardiovascular disorders is beginning to be recognized as important. In this study, we examined miRNA profiling in isolated diastolic dysfunction (DD) with preserved systolic function to identify promising candidate miRNAs. The presence of these miRNAs was tested in stable patients with isolated DD, patients with stable compensated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM-systolic plus diastolic dysfunction) and those with decompensated congestive heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM-CHF-systolic plus diastolic dysfunction). We identified new circulating miRNAs (miR-454, miR-500, miR-1246, miR-142-3p) which showed distinct patterns of expression in patients with diastolic dysfunction. The presence or absence of systolic dysfunction does not seem to affect this trend. MiR-454 and miR-500 are downregulated in diastolic dysfunction. MiR-1246 is upregulated in diastolic dysfunction. MiR-142-3p is downregulated in DCM and DCM-CHF groups but not in the DD group. The expression of miR-124-5p is highly upregulated in DCM but not in DD and DCM-CHF groups. We therefore propose that these circulating miRNAs may serve as novel biomarkers for diastolic dysfunction because in all of these patients the only common factor was diastolic dysfunction.
