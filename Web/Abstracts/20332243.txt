MicroRNA145 targets BNIP3 and suppresses prostate cancer progression. The putative tumor suppressor miR145 is transcriptionally regulated by TP53 and is downregulated in many tumors; however, its role in prostate cancer is unknown. On the other hand, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) is overexpressed in various tumors, including prostate cancer, and may transcriptionally repress the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) gene. Although BNIP3 transcription is controlled by hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (also elevated in prostate cancer), we postulated the posttranscriptional regulation of BNIP3 by miR145 through bioinformatics analysis, and herein we experimentally showed that miR145 negatively regulated BNIP3 by targeting its 3'-untranslated region. Artificial overexpression of miR145 by using adenoviral vectors in prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells significantly downregulated BNIP3, together with the upregulation of AIF, reduced cell growth, and increased cell death. Artificial overexpression of wild-type TP53 in PC-3 cells (which lack TP53 protein) and DU145 cells (in which mutated nonfunctioning TP53 is expressed) significantly upregulated miR145 expression with consequent effects on BNIP3 and cell behavior as with miR145 overexpression. Analysis of prostate cancer (n = 134) and benign prostate (n = 83) tissue sample showed significantly decreased miR145 and increased BNIP3 expression in prostate cancer (P &lt; 0.001), particularly in those with tumor progression, and both molecular changes were associated with unfavorable outcome. Abnormalities of the miR145-BNIP3 pair as part of TP53-miR145-BNIP3-AIF network may play a major role in prostate cancer pathogenesis and progression.
