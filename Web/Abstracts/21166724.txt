The microRNA molecular signature of atypic and common acquired melanocytic nevi: differential expression of miR-125b and let-7c. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which regulate gene expression through base pairing with mRNA and which are crucially involved in carcinogenesis (the so-called oncomiRs). We compared the miRNA signature between acquired melanocytic nevi showing clinical atypia (atypic nevi, AN) and common acquired nevi (common nevi, CN). We obtained miRNA profiles from 41 biopsies (22 AN and 19 CN) and showed that AN could be differentiated from CN on the basis of the expression of 36 miRNAs (false discovery rate &lt;0.05). OncomiRs were present in this group, and we further confirmed the differential expression of miR-125b and let-7c by qRT-PCR. Our data suggest that miRNAs are functionally involved in the pathogenesis of nevi and possibly malignant melanoma.
