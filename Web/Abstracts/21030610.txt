MicroRNA-92b regulates expression of the oligopeptide transporter PepT1 in intestinal epithelial cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally inhibit expression of target genes, have recently emerged as important regulators of many cellular functions such as cell differentiation. The epithelial di/tripeptide membrane transporter PepT1 is expressed in highly differentiated cells (the villous tip) but not in undifferentiated cells (the crypt) of the small intestine. Here, we investigated the regulation of PepT1 expression by miRNAs and its functional consequences. We observed a reverse correlation between the expression levels of PepT1 and mature miRNA-92b (miR-92b) during the differentiation of intestinal epithelial Caco2-BBE cells, suggesting a miR-92b-mediated regulation of PepT1 expression. We demonstrate that miR-92b suppressed PepT1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, with subsequent reduced PepT1 transport activity, in Caco2-BBE cells by directly targeting the PepT1 3'-untranslated region. In addition, miR-92b suppresses bacterial peptide-induced proinflammatory responses in intestinal epithelial cells by inhibiting PepT1 expression. Altogether, our study provides for the first time evidence for the regulation of PepT1 expression at a posttranscriptional level by miRNAs in intestinal epithelial cells during pathophysiological states.
