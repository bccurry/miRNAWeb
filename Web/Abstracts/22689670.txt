miR-125b transforms myeloid cell lines by repressing multiple mRNA targets. BackgroundWe previously described a t(2;11)(p21;q23) chromosomal translocation found in patients with myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia that leads to overexpression of the microRNA miR-125b, and we showed that transplantation of mice with murine stem/ progenitor cells overexpressing miR-125b is able to induce leukemia. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of myeloid transformation by miR-125b.Design and MethodsTo investigate the consequences of miR-125b overexpression on myeloid differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation, we used the NB4 and HL60 human promyelocytic cell lines and the 32Dclone3 murine promyelocytic cell line. To test whether miR-125b is able to transform myeloid cells, we used the non tumorigenic and IL-3 dependant 32Dclone3 cell line overexpressing miR-125b, in xenograft experiments in Nude mice and in IL-3 deprivation conditions. To identify new miR-125b targets, we compared by RNA-sequencing the transcriptome of cell lines overexpressing or not miR-125b.ResultsWe showed that miR-125b overexpression blocks apoptosis, myeloid differentiation and enhances proliferation in both species. More importantly, we demonstrated that miR-125b is able to transform the 32Dclone3 cell line by conferring growth independence to IL-3; xenograft experiments showed that these cells form tumors in Nude mice. Using RNA-sequencing and RQ-PCR experiments, we identified multiple miR-125b targets. We demonstrated that ABTB1, an anti-proliferative factor, is a new direct target of miR-125b and we confirmed that CBFB, a transcription factor involved in hematopoiesis, is also targeted by miR-125b. MiR-125b controls apoptosis by downregulating genes involved in the p53 pathway including BAK1 and TP53INP1. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that in a myeloid context, miR-125b is an oncomiR able to transform cell lines. miR-125b blocks myeloid differentiation in part by targeting CBFB, blocks apoptosis through downregulation of multiple genes involved in the p53 pathway, and confers a proliferative advantage to human and mouse myeloid cell lines in part by targeting ABTB1.
