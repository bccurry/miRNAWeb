Tumor suppressor microRNA-493 decreases cell motility and migration ability in human bladder cancer cells by downregulating RhoC and FZD4. The purpose of this study was to identify new tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNA; miR) in bladder cancer, conduct functional analysis of their suppressive role, and identify their specific target genes. To explore tumor suppressor miRs in bladder cancer, miR microarray was conducted using SV-HUC-1, T24, J82, and TCCSUP cells. Expression of miR-493 in bladder cancer (T24, J82, and TCCSUP) cells was downregulated compared with normal SV-HUC-1 cells. Also, the expression of miR-493 was significantly lower in bladder cancer tissues than in their corresponding noncancerous tissues. Transfection of miR-493 into T24 or J82 cells decreased their cell growth and migration abilities. On the basis of this result, to identify potential miR-493 target genes, we used target scan algorithms to identify target oncogenes related to invasion and migration. miR-493 decreased 3'-untranslated region luciferase activity and protein expression of FZD4 and RhoC. miR-493 also decreased binding of RhoC and Rock-1. miR-493 is a new tumor suppressor miRNA in bladder cancer and inhibits cell motility through downregulation of RhoC and FZD4.
