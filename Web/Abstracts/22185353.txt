MicroRNAs are dynamically regulated and play an important role in LPS-induced lung injury. Acute lung injury is characterized by an increase of inflammatory reaction and severe lung edema. Even if there have been great advances in the identification of genes and signaling pathways involved in acute lung injury, the fundamental mechanisms of initiation and propagation of acute lung injury have not been understood completely. A growing amount of evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in various human diseases. However, the expression profile and function of miRNAs in acute lung injury have not been investigated. Here, using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, we show that a collection of miRNAs is dynamically regulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse acute lung injury. Among them, miR-199a and miR-16 are the most significantly down-regulated miRNAs. To study the role of miR-199a and miR-16 in acute lung injury, an over-expression of miR-199a or miR-16 assay was performed in LPS-treated A549 cells, and then the expression of inflammatory factors was analyzed. Over-expression of miR-199a could not alter the expression level of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), while up-regulation of miR-16 could significantly down-regulate IL-6 and TNF expression level. Using bioinformatic analysis, we show that a 3' untranslational region (UTR) of IL-6 and TNF contains the binding sites of miR-16. Accordingly, over-expression of miR-16 could significantly suppress the luciferase activity of reporter fusion with the binding sites of TNF in its 3'UTR region, suggesting that miR-16 played its role in LPS-induced lung inflammation by a direct manner. In this study, we show for the first time that miRNAs are dynamically regulated and play an important function in LPS-induced lung injury.
