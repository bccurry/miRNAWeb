Elevated expression of mature miR-21 and miR-155 in cancerous gastric tissues from Chinese patients with gastric cancer. MicroRNA (miRNA) expression is deregulated in many types of human cancers. We sought to investigate the expression patterns of the miRNAs, miR-21, miR-145 and miR-155 in sporadic gastric cancer in a Chinese population. Total RNA was extracted from archived gastric cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from 20 pairs of paraffin-embedded specimens. Expression levels of miR-21, miR-145 and miR-155 were detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR using a specific stem-loop primer, with U6 as the internal reference gene. The expression of miR-21 and miR-155 in gastric cancer samples was significantly higher than in paired non-cancerous samples (P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in expression levels of miR-145 between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues (P &gt; 0.05). In Chinese sporadic gastric cancer tissues, the expressions of the oncogenic miR-21 and miR-155 were significantly up-regulated, while the expression of the tumor suppressor miR-145 was decreased, although this decrease was not statistically significant. Thus there is specificity in the miRNA expression pattern in gastric cancers in the Chinese population.
