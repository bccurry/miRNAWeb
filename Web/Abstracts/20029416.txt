Differential miRNA expression profiles in variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma and encapsulated follicular thyroid tumours. Recent studies showed a significant upregulation of distinct microRNAs (miRNAs) in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The objective of this study was to explore whether this upregulation could also be assigned to distinct histomorphological variants of PTC, especially the follicular variant and other encapsulated follicular thyroid tumours. We used total RNA of 113 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of 50 PTCs ((10 conventional type (PTC-CT), 10 tall cell variants (PTC-TCVs), 30 follicular variants (PTC-FVs)), 10 follicular adenomas (FAs), 10 multinodular goitres (MNGs), 21 follicular thyroid carcinomas and 22 well-differentiated tumours of unknown malignant potential (WDT-UMP) to analyse the miRNA expression pattern of five selected miRNAs (146b, 181b, 21, 221 and 222) using RT-PCR TaqMan miRNA assay to explore the diagnostic utility of this method. The mean values of the expression pattern of all miRNAS in PTCs show a statistically significant difference from those in MNG and FA with fold changes up to 90 for miRNA 146b, P&lt;0.001. No differences in expression pattern could be showed between MNG and FA. The PTC-FVs differ significantly from FA in all five miRNAS, from MNG in three and from WDT-UMP in one miRNA with fold changes between 1.7 and 21.2, but failed to be of diagnostic value regarding individual cases with substantial overlaps. We conclude that analysis of a set of five selected miRNAS distinguish common variants of PTC from FA/MNG but failed to be a useful diagnostic method in individual and doubtful cases, especially in the differential diagnosis of encapsulated follicular thyroid tumours.
