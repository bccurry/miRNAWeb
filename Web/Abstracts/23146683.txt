MicroRNA in aqueous humor from patients with cataract. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules with regulatory function and marked tissue specificity that can modulate multiple gene targets. They have been detected in body fluids and are associated with various physiologic and pathologic processes. We analyzed aqueous humor (AH) from human subjects undergoing cataract surgery to establish the presence and relative quantities of known miRNAs. AH was collected from patients without known ocular diseases other than cataract and a normal systemic history. Quantitative real-time PCR in an array platform was used to detect known miRNAs present in the AH. Among the 264 miRNAs tested, 110 were present in the AH. The top 5 abundant miRNAs identified were miR-202, miR-193b, miR-135a, miR-365, and miR-376a. The presence of miRNAs in AH suggests that they may have functional roles in regulating target genes in tissues lining the anterior chamber. Further analysis of the AH miRNA population may identify potential gene targets and provide insights regarding their roles in AH regulation, glaucoma and anterior segment disease processes.
