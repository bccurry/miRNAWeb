miR 488* inhibits androgen receptor expression in prostate carcinoma cells. Androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor, which plays a significant role in prostate carcinogenesis. Blockade of AR and its ligand, androgen is the basis for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). Nevertheless, a modest increase in the critical levels of AR mRNA and corresponding protein is sufficient for the development of resistance to antiandrogen therapy. A strategy to further downregulate AR mRNA and protein expression in combination with antiandrogen therapy may prevent or delay the development of androgen-independent PCa. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRNAs) perform tumor suppressor functions in various cancers. In this study, we demonstrate that the overexpression of miR 488* downregulates the transcriptional activity of AR and inhibits the endogenous AR protein production in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PCa cells. In addition, miR 488* blocks the proliferation and enhances the apoptosis of PCa cells. Our data indicate that miR 488* targets AR and is a potential modulator of AR mediated signaling. Our findings provide insight for utilizing miRNAs as novel therapeutics to target AR in PCa.
