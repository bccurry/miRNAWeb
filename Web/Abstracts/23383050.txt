Single cell microRNA analysis using microfluidic flow cytometry. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that have cell type and cell context-dependent expression and function. To study miRNAs at single-cell resolution, we have developed a novel microfluidic approach, where flow fluorescent in situ hybridization (flow-FISH) using locked-nucleic acid probes is combined with rolling circle amplification to detect the presence and localization of miRNA. Furthermore, our flow cytometry approach allows analysis of gene-products potentially targeted by miRNA together with the miRNA in the same cells. We demonstrate simultaneous measurement of miR155 and CD69 in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (PMA) and Ionomycin stimulated Jurkat cells. The flow-FISH method can be completed in 10 h, utilizes only 170 nL of reagent per experimental condition, and is the first to directly detect miRNA in single cells using flow cytometry.
