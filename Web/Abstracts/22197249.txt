MiR-342-5p suppresses coxsackievirus B3 biosynthesis by targeting the 2C-coding region. Coxsackievirus B type 3 (CVB3) is one of the major pathogens associated with human heart disease. miRNAs are a class of short, noncoding RNA that can post-transcriptionally modulate gene expression. By comparing the CVB3 genome and miR-342-5p sequences, we found there were potential miR-342-5p targets in the CVB3 genome. To verify the effect of miR-342-5p on CVB3 biosynthesis, HeLa cells were infected with a Renilla luciferase (RLuc)-expressing CVB3 variant (RLuc-CVB3). We observed that miR-342-5p could significantly inhibit the expression of RLuc in infected cells. In HeLa cells infected with an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-expressing CVB3 variant (EGFP-CVB3), EGFP expression was also significantly inhibited by miR-342-5p. The inhibitory effect of miR-342-5p on EGFP expression in EGFP-CVB3-infected cells could be reversed by transfection with anti-miR-342-5p oligonucleotide (AMO-miR-342-5p). Moreover, RNA and protein biosynthesis in wild-type CVB3 was significantly inhibited by miR-342-5p. By mutating the putative targets of miR-342-5p in the 2C-coding region, a sequence, nt4989-nt5015, was identified as the miR-342-5p target. The conserved nt4989-nt5015 sequences of CVB type 1-5 suggest miR-342-5p may exert its inhibitory effect in other types of coxsackievirus besides CVB3. Western blotting indicated that miR-342-5p could indeed suppress protein expression in CVB type 1 and 5. There was a moderate abundance of miR-342-5p in the gut, heart, and brain of Balb/c mice, suggesting that miR-342-5p may interact with CVB3 in vivo. Taken together, these results indicate that miR-342-5p can inhibit CVB3 biosynthesis by targeting its 2C-coding region and therefore may be a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of CVB3 infection.
