Has-miR-146a polymorphism (rs2910164) and cancer risk: a meta-analysis of 19 case-control studies. Epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between has-miR-146a polymorphism (rs2910164) and cancer risk. However, published data are still inconclusive. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the relationship between has-miR-146a polymorphism (rs2910164) and cancer susceptibility until May 8, 2010. Nineteen published case-control studies including a total of 10,496 cases and 12,885 controls were acquired. Overall, Increased cancer risk was found in domain model (OR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.35) rather than in other genetic models when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. Stratified analysis shown that significant association between rs2910164 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility was present in Asians (OR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.01-1.29 for CG vs. CC; OR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.39 for GG+CG vs. CC), but not in Caucasian populations. In the subgroup analysis by cancer types, no significantly increased risk of breast, gastric, prostate or bladder cancer were found in any of the genetic models. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that has-miR-146a polymorphism (rs2910164) is associated with increased cancer susceptibility in Asians. However, further well-designed studies with large sample size will be necessary to validate the risk identified in the current meta-analysis.
