MicroRNA-193b regulates c-Kit proto-oncogene and represses cell proliferation in acute myeloid leukemia. Mutations and/or overexpression of c-Kit proto-oncogene frequently occur in subsets of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and contribute to abnormal cell proliferation and poor outcomes. We showed that c-Kit expression was subject to post-transcriptional regulation by microRNA (miRNA)-193b. Notably, miR-193b was significantly down-regulated in the examined AML cells and its levels were inversely correlated with c-Kit levels. Restoration of miR-193b expression in AML cells resulted in distinctly reduced c-Kit expression and inhibited cell growth. These data reveal a role for miR-193b dysregulation in myeloid leukemogenesis and the therapeutic promise of regulating miR-193b expression for c-Kit-positive AML.
