[Significance of miR-155, miR-34a and miR-30a expression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]. To determine the expressions of miR-155, miR-34a and miR-30a in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and to explore their potential correlation with clinicopathological characteristics. The expression level of miR-155, miR-34a and miR-30a in 46 DLBCL samples were determined with TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) was performed to detect MYC and p53 genes' status, and immunohistochemistry (Envision method) was used to evaluate the expression of CD3, CD10, CD20, BCL-6 and MUM-1 in DLBCL. The DLBCLs were classified into germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and non germinal center B cell-like (non-GCB) subtypes according to Hans' criteria. Compared with normal controls, miR-155 expression level was significantly higher in DLBCL. The expression level of miR-155 in non-GCB type was higher than that in GCB type. It was shown that the patients with MYC rearrangement had lower expression level of miR-155 than the negative controls. Compared with p53 normal group, the expression level of miR-34a was significantly lower in p53 deletion group. It was also shown that the patients with BCL-6 protein expression had lower expression of miR-30a compared with the negative group. miR-155 expression level is different in normal controls, DLBCL and patients with subtype DLBCL. It therefore has a diagnosis value for DLBCL. miR-34a is of great prognostic significance. miR-155, miR-34a and miR-30a may be potential therapy targets for DLBCL.
