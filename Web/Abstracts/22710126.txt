MicroRNA-23b downregulates peroxiredoxin III in human prostate cancer. To investigate the mechanism by which peroxiredoxin III (PRDX3) is altered in human prostate cancer (PCa), we used microRNA (miRNA) target prediction program and miRNA microarray to predict and identify miR-23b as a candidate miRNA that targets PRDX3. We showed that miR-23b suppresses PRDX3 protein expression in human DU145 cells under normal and hypoxic conditions. Additionally, the clinical significance of miR-23b and PRDX3 expression in PCa patients was also confirmed. In conclusion, our data suggest that the effects of PRDX3 in PCa progression may be caused by the regulation function of miR-23b, and consequently, miR-23b may be involved in the response of PCa cells to hypoxia stress.
