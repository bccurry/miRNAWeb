Differential expression of oncogenic miRNAs in proliferating and senescent human fibroblasts. miRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that play fundamental roles through the post-transcriptional regulation of target mRNAs. miRNAs have been shown to regulate a broad spectrum of biological activities, including development, differentiation, cell death, and oncogenesis. However, little is known about their contribution to cellular senescence. The authors analyzed the expression of 576 miRNAs in proliferating and senescent normal human fibroblasts by microarray, and identified 12 miRNAs that were differentially expressed in proliferating and senescent fibroblasts. Interestingly, all six miRNAs that were down-regulated in senescent cells had been previously reported to be aberrantly expressed in tumor cells. It was further showed that inhibition of miR-17-5p and miR-20a by 2'-O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides resulted in the induction of senescent phenotypes in WI-38 cells.
