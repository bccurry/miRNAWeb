Association between two genetic variants in miRNA and primary liver cancer risk in the Chinese population. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the growth and development of human beings. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within miRNA could change their production or affinity with target genes, thus leading to malignant diseases. This case-control study conducted in Western China aimed to explore the relationship between polymorphisms in miR-146a (rs2910164 G&gt;C) and miR-499 (rs3746444 T&gt;C) and primary liver cancers in the Chinese population. 186 primary liver cancer cases and 483 healthy controls were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. No significant differences were observed between distributions of the two SNPs and susceptibility of primary liver cancer or diverse clinicopathologic features. However, we found that patients with genotype CG of the SNP in miR-146a tended to have earlier onset and better liver function than patients with genotype CC (average age: 49.9 vs. 54.9, p=0.038; average Child-Pugh grade: 5.55 vs. 6.15, p=0.021), and further analysis showed that patients who had at least one G allele were diagnosed at an earlier age (average age: 49.6 vs. 54.9, p=0.022) and had better liver function (average Child-Pugh grade:5.60 vs. 6.15, p=0.026). Our data suggested lack of association between the two SNPs and primary liver cancer risk, though, interestingly, the miR-146a SNP may influence the age of onset and Child-Pugh grade.
