Down-regulation of miR-125a-3p in human gastric cancer and its clinicopathological significance. Recent reports have demonstrated that another strand of mature microRNA (miRNA), called microRNA* or 3p (5p) strand, which is generated from the same precursor miRNA (Pre-miR), has a crucial role in cellular function. We previously reported the tumor suppressive effect of miR-125a-5p in gastric cancer. The current study was designed to examine the function and clinical significance of miR-125a-3p, a partner strand of miR-125a-5p, in human gastric cancer. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to evaluate miR-125a-3p expression in 70 gastric cancer cases to determine the clinicopathologic significance of miR-125a-3p expression. In addition, the effect of miR-125a-3p on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells was investigated. Low expression levels of miR-125a-3p were associated with indicators of enhanced malignant potential such as tumor size (p=0.0002), tumor invasion (p=0.0149), lymph node metastasis (p=0.018), liver metastasis (p=0.016), peritoneal dissemination (p=0.03), advanced clinical stage (p=0.0037) and poor prognosis (p=0.0083). Multivariate analysis indicated that low miR-125a-3p expression was an independent prognostic factor for survival, while in vitro assays demonstrated that miR125a-3p suppressed the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. MiR-125a-3p is a potent prognostic marker in gastric cancer. The clinical significance and tumor suppressive effect of miR125a-3p, as well as previously reported miR-125a-5p, suggest that the functional role of another strand of the mature form miRNA cannot be ignored, at least in miR-125a biogenesis.
