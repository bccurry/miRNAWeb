MicroRNA-9 regulates the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  in human monocytes during the inflammatory response. PPAR is involved in the inflammatory response and its expression is induced by cytokines, however, limited knowledge has been produced regarding its regulation. Since recent findings have shown that microRNAs, which are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, are involved in the immune response, we set out to investigate whether PPAR can be regulated by microRNAs expressed in monocytes. Bioinformatic analysis identified a putative miR-9 target site within the 3'-UTR of PPAR that was subsequently verified to be functional using reporter constructs. Primary human monocytes stimulated with LPS showed a downregulation of PPAR and its target genes after 4 h while the expression of miR-9 was induced. Analysis of pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages showed that human PPAR mRNA as well as miR-9 expression was higher in M1 compared to M2 macrophages. Furthermore, treatment with the PPAR agonist, GW501516, induced the expression of PPAR target genes in the pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages while no change was observed in the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Taken together, these data suggest that PPAR is regulated by miR-9 in monocytes and that activation of PPAR may be of importance in M1 pro-inflammatory but not in M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages in humans.
