[Expressions of bcl-6, lpp and miR-28 genes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines]. This study was purposed to explore the expressions of bcl-6, lpp and miR-28 genes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines at the levels of gene and protein, and the relationship between them. Northern blot was used to detect bcl-6 and lpp mRNA expression in 8 DLBCL cell lines. Solution hybridization was used to measure miR-28 expression, and Western blot was performed for BCL-6 and LPP protein determinations. The results showed that the expression of bcl-6 mRNA was higher in the cell lines with Ig/BCL-6 translocation (Oc1-ly8, MD903, CTB-1, and MD901), and negative in those without Ig/BCL-6 translocation (HRC57 and K231). The expression of lpp mRNA in CTB-1 cell line was negative. MiR-28 was positive in all cell lines, and the expression levels from high to low were in line as follows: K231, CTB-1, MD903, HRC57, MD901, RCK8, OC1-LY8 and BEVA. BCL-6 protein was also positive in all of cell lines, and the expression levels from high to low were as follows: RCK8, BEVA, MD901, CTB-1, MD903, OC1-LY8, HRC57 and K231. LPP protein was negative in K231 cells, and the expression levels in other cells from high to low were line up as follows: HRC57, OC1-LY8, BEVA, RCK8, CTB-1, MD901 and MD903. The expression levels of bcl-6 and lpp mRNA were not consistent with expression levels of protein. It is concluded that the gene expression levels of bcl-6, lpp and miR-28 are different in various DLBCL cell lines. The expression levels of bcl-6 and lpp mRNA are not parallel with expression levels of protein. The roles of bcl-6, lpp and miR-28 in initiation and development of DLBCL need further investigation.
