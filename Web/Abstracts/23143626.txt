Hsa-miR-196a2 functional SNP is associated with severe toxicity after platinum-based chemotherapy of advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer patients in a Chinese population. Rs11614913 is a polymorphism in hsa-miR-196a2 reported to alter mature microRNA expression and function. This single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was reported to be associated with susceptibility and prognosis of lung cancer. In this article, association study was performed to reveal the relation between SNP and response rate or severe toxicity after platinum-based regimen in advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer patients. By screening this polymorphism in 442 Chinese patients with MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometer, significantly higher occurrence of grade 3 or 4 overall toxicity (P = 0.02) in response to treatment was found in patients with homozygous CC. After stratified analyses, association between rs11614912 and overall toxicity existed, especially in individuals treated with gemcitabine (P = 0.006) or cisplatin (P = 0.008), and in male patients (P = 0.02) or younger patients (P = 0.01). Our study confirmed that rs11614913 in hsa-miR-196a2 was associated with severe toxicity in lung cancer patients, and might help to improve individualized therapy in the future.
