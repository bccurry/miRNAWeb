Converging miRNA functions in diverse brain disorders: a case for miR-124 and miR-126. A growing body of information on the biology of miRNAs has revealed new insight into their roles in normal homeostasis and pathology of disease. miRNAs control all steps of the cellular expression machinery acting through a &quot;single miRNA/multiple targets&quot; or &quot;multiple miRNAs/single target&quot; mechanism. They have profound impact on the regulation of signaling pathways, which govern common and specific functions across different cellular phenotypes. There is increasing evidence that various diseases share similar disturbances in gene expression networks. Since miRNAs have both common and varying effects in different cellular contexts, they might also influence overlapping signaling pathways in different organs and disease entities. Here, we review this concept for two miRNAs highly abundant in the brain, miR-124 and miR-126, and their potential role in diseases of the brain.
