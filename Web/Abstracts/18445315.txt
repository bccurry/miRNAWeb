[MicroRNA profiles of malignantly transformed cells induced by anti-benzo-a-pyrene-trans-7, 8-dihydrodiol-9, 10-epoxide]. To screen microRNA (miRNA) profiles of malignantly transformed cells induced by anti-benzo-a-pyrene-trans-7, 8-dihydrodiol-9, 10-epoxide (BPDE) and to look for miRNAs which is expressed differently between malignantly transformed cells and normal human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE. Experimental group was the malignantly transformed 16HBE which was induced by cultured with final concentration 2.0 micromol/L of BPDE which was dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide. The control group was 16HBE that was cultured with minimal essential medium including dimethyl sulphoxide. 327 miR-NAs were tested be-tween those two groups with miRNA microarray analysis. MiR-10a that was down expressed and miR-320 that was overexpressed were selected to be validated by miRNA specific quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase chain reaction (miR qRT-PCR). 327 human miRNAs were tested with miRNA microarray analysis. 55 miRNAs were found expressing differently between those two groups and of which 46 were overexpressed and 9 were down expressed. Some data were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. miRNAs expressed significantly between malignantly transformed 16HBE and normal cells and this helps us look for unique miRNAs of malignantly transformed cells induced by BPDE, but there should have more sufficient evidences to prove their functions in malignant cells.
