Altered microRNA expression in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells and upregulation of miR-130a associated with MDR1/P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance. microRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules which are involved in the regulation of various biological processes. Drug resistance has become a major obstacle to successful chemotherapy of ovarian cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate microRNA expression profiles in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells and the role of miR-130a in regulating drug resistance. Analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs between SKOV3 and SKOV3/CIS cells was assessed by miRNA microarrays. Target prediction of miRNAs was determined with the help of PicTar or TargetScan. Among these miRNAs, the expression of miR130a was verified using qRT-PCR. The expression of MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) after cellular transfection was examined using qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Cisplatin sensitivity was detected by the MTT assay. We indentified 35 downregulated and 54 upregulated miRNAs in SKOV3/CIS compared to those in SKOV3. We found that miR-130a was upregulated in SKOV3/CIS compared to the parental SKOV3 cells, and PTEN was predicted to be the potential target of miR-130a. Moreover, downregulation of miR-130a could inhibit MDR1 mRNA and P-gp expression and overcome the cisplatin resistance in SKOV3/CIS cells, which indicated that miR-130a may be associated with MDR1/P-gp-mediated drug resistance and plays the role of an intermediate in drug-resistance pathways of PI3K/Akt/PTEN/mTOR and ABC superfamily drug transporters in SKOV3/CIS cells. This study provides important information for the development of targeted gene therapy for reversing cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer.
