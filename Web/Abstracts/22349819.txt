REV3L 3'UTR 460 T&gt;C polymorphism in microRNA target sites contributes to lung cancer susceptibility. REV3Lp, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, is the major participant in translesion DNA synthesis. Recent evidence suggests that REV3L has an important role in the maintenance of genome stability despite its mutagenic characteristics. Such a function makes it a cancer susceptibility candidate gene. To investigate association between REV3L polymorphisms and lung cancer risk in a Chinese population, we first genotyped 15 common polymorphisms of the REV3L gene and found that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs465646, rs459809 and rs1002481) were significantly associated with lung cancer risk. One of the strongest associations observed was for the 3'-terminal untranslated region (3'UTR) 460 T&gt;C polymorphism (rs465646) (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.69 for TC/CC; P=0.007, compared with TT). Similar results were obtained in a subsequent replication study (adjusted OR=0.72; P=0.016). Combined data from the two studies of 1072 lung cancer patients and 1064 cancer-free controls generated an even stronger association (adjusted OR=0.71; P=3.04  10(-4)). This 3'UTR 460 T&gt;C variant was predicted to modulate the binding of several micro RNAs. Surface plasmon resonance analysis and luciferase assays showed that the T allele demonstrated a stronger binding affinity for miR-25 and miR-32, resulting in significantly weaker reporter expression levels. Additional experiments revealed that miR-25/32 could downregulate endogenous REV3L. Furthermore, the tumor-suppressing role of REV3L was confirmed by the foci formation assay. These results support our hypothesis that the REV3L rs465646 variant modifies lung cancer susceptibility in Chinese Han population by affecting miRNA-mediated gene regulation.
