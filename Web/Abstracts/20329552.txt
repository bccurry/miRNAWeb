[Construction of highly effective artifical miRNA targeted to HIV-1 vif and the lentiviral-mediated antiviral research in vitro]. Effective and specific RNA interference (RNAi) elements are essential for the RNAi-based anti-HIV-1 research which has achieved extensive application. vif37 targeted to HIV-1 vi f is a highly effective and conserved RNAi target obtained from the previous study on screening. In this study, we explored the construction of artificial miRNAs to induce RNAi targeted to vif37, which had advantages on inhibition efficiency and flexibility of promoter selection. Three artificial miRNA targeted to vif37 were constructed by walking method using native miR-155 as a backbone and expressed by RNA polymerase II promoter. Then, expression vectors of artificial miRNA were co-transfected with HIV-1 infectious clone pNL4-3 to score its inhibition ability and showed that only miR-vif37 had the significant inhibition efficiency similar to shRNA-vif37. Subsequently, co-transfections with luciferase reporter plasmids into which different target sequences were inserted proved the specificity of miR-vif37 H. The replication of HIV-1 was inhibited in MT-4-miR37 H cells which could express miR-vif37 H stably and were cloned from MT-4 cells transducted with recombinant lentiviral vectors containing the miR-vif37 H expression element. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that miR-vif37 H had much lower expression level than shRNA-vif37. Results also showed that intracellular miR-181 and miR-16 expression levels and stat1 mRNA levels were not effected by the expression of miR-vif37 H in MT-4-miR37 H cells. We conclude miR-vif37 is a specific and highly effective artificial miRNA which will promote the further application of vif37 target.
