MicroRNA-25 promotes cell migration and invasion in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as a species of small non coding single stranded RNA of about 21-25 nucleotides have important roles in the development of different cancers. In present study, we found that the expression of miR-25 was up-regulated in 60 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues compared with matched adjacent non-cancer tissues. Moreover, we demonstrated that the up-regulation of miR-25 was significantly correlated with the status of lymph node metastasis and TNM (Tumor, Node and Metastasis) stage. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-25 markedly promoted migration and invasion of ESCC cells. On the contrary, down-regulation of miR-25 inhibited the migration and invasion of cells. E-cadherin(CDH1) is a very important tumor metastasis suppressor. We further identified that miR-25 directly targeted CDH1 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) and repressed the expression of CDH1. These results, for the first time, demonstrate that miR-25 promotes ESCC cell migration and invasion by suppressing CDH1 expression.
