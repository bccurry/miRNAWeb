NEDD9, a novel target of miR-145, increases the invasiveness of glioblastoma. miR-145 is an important repressor of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and a tumor suppressor in different cancers. Here, we found that miR-145 is strongly down-regulated in glioblastoma (GB) specimens and corresponding glioblastomaneurospheres (GB-NS, containing GB stem-like cells) compared to normal brain (NB) and to low-grade gliomas (LGG). We observed a direct correlation between miR-145 expression and the progression-free survival (PFS) in LGG patients and overall survival (OS) in GB patients. Using microarray analysis, we identified relevant differences in gene expression profiles between GB-NS over-expressing miR-145 (miRover-NS) and GB-NS Empty (Empty-NS). We focused our attention on HEF1/Cas-L/NEDD9, a scaffold protein involved in invasion in several types of cancer. We confirmed a significant down-regulation of NEDD9 in miRover-NS and we found a higher expression in GB and GB-NS compared to NB. Approximately 50% of LGG patients expressed higher levels of NEDD9 than NB, and the PFS of such patients was shorter than in patients expressing lower levels of NEDD9. We observed that intracranial injection of GB-NS over-expressing miR-145 delays significantly tumor development :deriving tumors showed a significant down-regulation of NEDD9. In addition, we demonstrated a significant inhibition of invasion in silencing experiments with GB-NS shNEDD9 (shNEDD9), and an up-regulation of miR-145 in shNEDD9, suggesting a doublenegative feedback loop between miR-145 and NEDD9. Our results demonstrate the critical role of miR-145 and NEDD9 in regulating glioblastoma invasion and suggest a potential role of NEDD9 as a biomarker for glioma progression.
