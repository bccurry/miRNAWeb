Identification of new aberrantly expressed miRNAs in intestinal-type gastric cancer and its clinical significance. miRNAs are small 19 to 22 nucleotide sequences of RNA that negatively regulate gene expression. miRNA expression profiles may become useful biomarkers for diagnostics, prognosis and prediction of response to treat, and it could be a powerful tool for cancer prevention and therapeutics. Several miRNA expression profiles of miRNAs in gastric cancer have been reported, but these studies screened only few miRNAs and samples used in experiments include several different subtypes of gastric cancers, which decrease the sensitivity to identify new aberrant miRNAs. In this study, a miRNA expression profile was identified by miRCURY LNA Array (v.14.0) between intestinal-type gastric cancers and normal tissues. Forty miRNA precursors were up-regulated and thirty-six miRNA were down-regulated in intestinal-type gastric cancers (p&lt;0.01). Sixteen new miRNAs were found in intestinal-type gastric cancers. Seventeen new miRNAs were found in intestinal-type gastric cancers. miR-145, miR-27a, miR-494 are differently expressed between intestinal-type and diffuse-type gastric cancers. miR-32, miR-182 and miR-143 dysregulated expression levels are related with different pathological stages of intestinal-type gastric cancers (p&lt;0.01). Taken together, aberrantly expressed miRNAs may offer new clues to tumorigenesis of gastric cancers. miR-32, miR-182 and miR-143 may be potential diagnostic biomarkers for intestinal-type gastric cancers.
