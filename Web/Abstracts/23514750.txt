A novel onco-miR-365 induces cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The expression levels of miR-365 vary in different malignancies. Herein, we found that miR-365 was overexpressed in both cells and clinical specimens of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We demonstrated that the HaCaT(pre-miR-365-2) cell line, which overexpressed miR-365, could induce subcutaneous tumors in vivo. Antagomir-365, an anti-miR-365 oligonucleotide, inhibited cutaneous tumor formation in vivo, along with G1 phase arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells. These findings suggest that miR-365 may act as an onco-miR in cutaneous SCC both in vitro and in vivo. The present study provides valuable insight into the role of miR-365 in cutaneous SCC formation, which can help develop new drug and miR-365 target-based therapies for cutaneous SCC.
