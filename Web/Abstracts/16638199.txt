[Expression of miR-28 in B cell lymphoma cell lines detected by solution hybridization]. microRNA (miRNA) is evolutionarily conserved, non-coding small RNA (19-25 nt) involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. To further understand the biogenesis and functions of miRNA, and to quantify miRNA expression levels, the expression of miR-28 in B lymphoma cell lines was detected by solution hybridization and Northern blot, and their detected results were compared. The results indicated that detection of miR-28 by solution hybridization and Northern blot showed positive, but total RNA amount used for solution hybridization detection was significantly lower than that for Northern blot detection (5 microg vs 30 microg), signal of solution hybridization was stronger than that of Northern blot. It is concluded that the solution hybridization for detection of miR-28 in B cell lymphoma cell lines is a faster and more sensitive method as compared with standard Northern blot technique.
