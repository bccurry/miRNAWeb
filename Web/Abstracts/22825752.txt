MicroRNA-9 suppresses uveal melanoma cell migration and invasion through the NF-B1 pathway. The aggressive course of uveal melanoma is believed to reflect its unusually invasive and metastatic nature, which is associated with the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-B) pathway. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the regulation of various biological and pathological processes in cancer, however, the special role of miR-9 in uveal melanoma metastasis is largely unknown. In the present study, we showed that miR-9 is significantly reduced in highly invasive uveal melanoma cell lines, and suppressed migration and invasion of highly invasive cells. Furthermore, miR-9 negatively modulated NF-B1 expression by direct targeting at its 3'-UTRs. Additionally, downstream targets of NF-B1, such as MMP-2, MMP-9 and VEGFA, were regulated by miR-9 in the same pattern as NF-B1. Therefore, miR-9 suppresses uveal melanoma cell migration and invasion partly through downregulation of the NF-B1 signaling pathway.
