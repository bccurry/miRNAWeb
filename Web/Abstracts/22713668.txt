MicroRNA-203 suppresses cell proliferation and migration by targeting BIRC5 and LASP1 in human triple-negative breast cancer cells. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: This study was performed to investigate the effect of microRNA-203 (miR-203) on cell proliferation and migration in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). METHODS: Real-time PCR was performed to detect the expression of miR-203 in TNBC cell lines. miR-203 precursor and control microRNA (miRNA) were transfected into triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and the effects of miR-203 up-regulation on the proliferation and migration of cells were investigated. Meanwhile, the mRNA and protein levels of baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC5) and Lim and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP1) were measured. Luciferase assays were also performed to validate BIRC5 and LASP1 as miR-203 targets. RESULTS: Both miR-203 and BIRC5 siRNA signicantly inhibited cell proliferation in TNBC cells. Both miR-203 and LASP1 siRNA signicantly inhibited cell migration in TNBC cells, also. Moreover, up-regulated of BIRC5 and LASP1 was able to abrogate the effects induced by transfection with the miR-203 precursor. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that miR-203 may function as a tumor suppressor in TNBC cells. Thus, miR-203 could be a potential therapeutic target for this disease.
