MicroRNA-146a regulates survival and maturation of human plasmacytoid dendritic cells. During microbial infections, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a main source of type I interferons (IFNs)-/. Nucleic acids from microbes are sensed by Toll-like-receptor (TLR)-7/9, which are selectively expressed in pDCs. Activated pDCs also produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulate co-stimulatory molecules. Together this equips pDCs with the ability to prime T, B, and NK cells and conventional (c)-DCs, thereby initiating adaptive immune responses. To avoid deleterious effects to the host, tight regulation of pDC activation is required. Despite numerous data linking aberrant activation of pDCs with autoimmune diseases, little is known about mechanisms controlling pDC activation. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) in TLR pathway regulation in human pDCs. We show that miR-146a expression was induced upon TLR7/9 signalling. Furthermore, ectopic miR-146a expression effectively impaired TLR-mediated signalling in pDCs as TLR-induced NF-B activation was reduced. This consequently diminished the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduced pDC survival. Moreover, miR-146a expressing pDCs had decreased ability to induce CD4(+) T cell proliferation likely due to reduced expression levels of MHCII and co-stimulatory molecules. Taken together, these data unravel the crucial immunomodulatory role of miR-146a in pDCs and may add to our understanding of aberrant responses in autoimmune diseases.
