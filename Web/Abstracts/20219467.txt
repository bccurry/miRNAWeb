Identification of MyD88 as a novel target of miR-155, involved in negative regulation of Helicobacter pylori-induced inflammation. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) has been implicated as a central regulator of the immune system. We have previously reported that miR-155 negatively regulates Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-induced inflammation, but the molecular mechanism of miR-155 regulating the inflammation is not fully clear. Here, we identified myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88) as a target gene of miR-155, and found that miR-155 decreased MyD88 expression at the protein but not the mRNA message level, suggesting that the miR-155-mediated inhibition is a post-transcriptional event. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-155 led to significantly reduced IL-8 production induced by H. pylori infection. Thus, we have demonstrated that miR-155 can negatively regulate inflammation by targeting a key adaptor molecule MyD88 in inflammatory pathways.
