miR-205 promotes tumor proliferation and invasion through targeting ESRRG in endometrial carcinoma. Increasing evidence suggests that miR205 is frequently dysregulated in many types of human cancers, suggesting its important roles in the initiation and progression of cancer. However, the functions of miR205 in human endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (EEC) are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of miR205 in both normal endometrium and EEC tissues using TaqManPCR. Compared to normal tissues, miR205 was significantly upregulated in EEC (P&lt;0.001). After transfection of miR205 inhibitors into Ishikawa cells (or transfection of miR205 mimics into AN3CA cells), we demonstrated that the cellular proliferation, migration and invasion properties were negatively regulated by miR205. Moreover, by combination of microRNA target prediction algorithms and luciferase reporter system, we identified estrogen-related receptor (ESRRG) as a target of miR205. In conclusion, we demonstrated frequent upregulation of miR205 in EEC. In gainoffunction and lossoffunction assays, inhibition of miR205 reduced cellular proliferation, migration and invasion; vice versa, increased levels of miR205 led to upregulated cellular proliferation, migration and invasion. Nonetheless, we identified the ESRRG gene to be a novel target, which could be helpful to elucidate mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis of EEC.
