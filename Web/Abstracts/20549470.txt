The role of hypoxia regulated microRNAs in cancer. The molecular response of cancer cells to hypoxia is the focus of intense research. In the last decade, research into microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs which have a role in regulation of mRNA and translation, has grown exponentially. miR-210 has emerged as the predominant miRNA regulated by hypoxia. Elucidation of its targets points to a variety of roles for this, and other hypoxia-regulated miRNAs (HRMs), in tumour growth and survival. miR-210 expression correlates with poor survival in cancer patients, and shows promise for future use as a tumour marker or therapeutic agent. The role of miR-210 and other HRMs in cancer biology is the subject of this review.
