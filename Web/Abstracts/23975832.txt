Down-regulation of tumor suppressor MBP-1 by microRNA-363 in gastric carcinogenesis. Gastric carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies and the second most lethal cancer worldwide. The mechanisms underlying aggressiveness of gastric cancer still remain obscure. c-Myc promoter binding protein 1 (MBP-1) is a negative regulator of c-myc expression and ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues. It is produced by alternative translation initiation of -enolase gene. Both MBP-1 and -enolase are involved in the control of tumorigenesis including gastric cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenesis and could have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic potential. In the present study, whether miRNAs modulate tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells through targeting MBP-1 was evaluated. We found that miR-363 targets 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of human MBP-1/-enolase mRNA. The exogenous miR-363 promotes growth, viability, progression, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and tumorsphere formation of SC-M1 gastric cancer cells through down-regulation of MBP-1. Whereas, the knockdown of endogenous miR-363 suppresses tumorigenesis and progression of SC-M1 cells via up-regulation of MBP-1. The miR-363/MBP-1 axis is also involved in the control of carcinogenesis in KATO III and SNU-16 gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, miR-363 induces the xenografted tumor growth and lung metastasis of SC-M1 cells through MBP-1 in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-363 plays an important role in the increment of gastric carcinogenesis via targeting MBP-1.
