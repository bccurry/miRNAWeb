[Screening of differentially expressed microRNAs in borderline and malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors]. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have a broad spectrum of biological behaviors ranging from benign, borderline and malignant. This study aimed to screen differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) between malignant and borderline GISTs and to investigate the potential role of miRNAs in the malignant transformation of GISTs. Six GIST samples including borderline tumors (n = 3) and malignant tumors (n = 3) were collected based on the clinical and pathological characteristics. Total RNA was extracted, followed by miRNA microarray analysis to screen the differentially expressed miRNAs. The most significantly expressed 4 miRNAs were then chosen for further validation by real-time PCR in 22 additional GIST samples. Direct comparison of malignant group versus borderline group revealed 14 significantly and differentially expressed miRNAs (P &lt; 0.05, with a fold change of &lt; 0.5 or &gt; 2). Five miRNAs were up-regulated and nine were down-regulated in the malignant group. Four miRNAs (miR-221, miR-135b, miR-675(*) and miR-218) were most significantly and differentially expressed between the two groups. The differential expression of 2 miRNAs (miR-221 and miR-675(*)) were subsequently confirmed with good concordance by real-time PCR. The differential miRNA expression profiles between two groups are revealed by miRNA microarray assay, and confirmed by real-time PCR. Among differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-221 and miR-675(*) might be related to the malignant transformation of GISTs, and have a potential value in predicting biological behavior of GISTs.
