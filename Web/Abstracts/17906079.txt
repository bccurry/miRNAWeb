MicroRNA miR-24 inhibits erythropoiesis by targeting activin type I receptor ALK4. MicroRNAs have been suggested to modulate a variety of cellular events. Here we report that miR-24 regulates erythroid differentiation by influencing the expression of human activin type I receptor ALK4 (hALK4). Ectopic expression of miR-24 reduces the mRNA and protein levels of hALK4 by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of hALK4 mRNA and interferes with activin-induced Smad2 phosphorylation and reporter expression. Furthermore, miR-24 represses the activin-mediated accumulation of hemoglobin, an erythroid differentiation marker, in erythroleukemic K562 cells and decreases erythroid colony-forming and burst-forming units of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. ALK4 expression is inversely correlated with miR-24 expression during the early stages of erythroid differentiation, and the forced expression of miR-24 leads to a delay of activin-induced maturation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in liquid culture. Thus, our findings define a regulation mode of miR-24 on erythropoiesis by impeding ALK4 expression.
