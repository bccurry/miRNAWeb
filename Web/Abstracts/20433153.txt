Electrochemical detection of microRNAs via gap hybridization assay. MicroRNAs have recently been associated with cancer development by acting as tumor suppressors or oncogenes and could therefore be applied as molecular markers for early diagnosis of cancer. In this work, we established a rapid, selective, and sensitive gap hybridization assay for detection of mature microRNAs based on four components DNA/RNA hybridization and electrochemical detection using esterase 2-oligodeoxynucleotide conjugates. Complementary binding of microRNA to a gap built of capture and detector oligodeoxynucleotide, the reporter enzyme is brought to the vicinity of the electrode and produces enzymatically an electrochemical signal. In the absence of microRNA, the gap between capture and detector oligodeoxynucleotide is not filled, and missing base stacking energy destabilizes the hybridization complex. The gap hybridization assay demonstrates selective detection of miR-16 within a mixture of other miRNAs, including the feasibility of single mismatch discrimination. Applying the biosensor assay, a detection limit of 2 pM or 2 amol of miR-16 was obtained. Using isolated total RNA from human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells, the assay detected specifically miR-21 and miR-16 in parallel, and higher expression of oncogene miR-21 compared to miR-16 was demonstrated. Including RNA isolation, the gap hybridization assay was developed with a total assay time of 60 min and without the need for reverse transcription PCR amplification of the sample. The characteristics of the assay developed in this work could satisfy the need for rapid and easy methods for early cancer marker detection in clinical diagnostics.
