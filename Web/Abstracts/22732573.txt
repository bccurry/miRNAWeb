miRNAs, a potential target in the treatment of Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinomas (NSCLC). Lung cancer is a serious public health problem and Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, NSCLC, is particularly resistant to current treatments. So it is important to find new strategies that are active against NSCLC. miRNA is implicated in cancer and may be implicated in NSCLC. Our team has been working on two genes HEF1, a gene implicated in different functions of cell cycle and B2, a large non-coding RNA (nc RNA). These two genes have the same localisation: chromosome 6 and locus p24-25. nc RNA B2 may be involved in the regulation of HEF1. Firstly, we examine a bank of different human miRNAs known to interact with exons of HEF1. HEF1 and B2 were overexpressed in vitro by treating NSCLC-N6 with the cytostatic molecule A190, and carried out qRT-PCR for the expression of miRNA. Secondly, using specific software, we sought for structures originating from the B2 RNA sequence which might interact with HEF1 and assessed their expression. This strategy enabled us to confirm firstly that known miRNAs that can interact with exons of HEF1 are expressed in NSCLC-N6 cells. More precisely this strategy highlighted overexpression of one miRNA, hsa-miR-146b, listed in miRbase. The second step of the studies highlighted the expression of miRNA, potentially sequences originating from B2 in the NSCLC-N6. This miRNA overexpressed might be one of the regulators of the gene HEF1 and consequently implies on the carcinogenesis of lung cancer. So in the future it could be a potential and an innovative way to find a new strategy for the treatment of lung cancer.
