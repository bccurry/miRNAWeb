Detection of gastric cancer-associated microRNAs on microRNA microarray comparing pre- and post-operative plasma. Recently, it was reported that plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) are low-invasive useful biomarkers for cancer. We attempted to isolate gastric cancer (GC)-associated miRNAs comparing pre- and post-operative paired plasma, thereby excluding the possible effects of individual variability. This study was divided into four steps: (1) microarray analysis comparing pre- and post-operative plasma; (2) validation of candidate miRNAs by quantitative RT-PCR; (3) validation study of selected miRNAs using paired plasma; and (4) comparison of the levels of selected miRNAs in plasma between healthy controls and patients. From the results of microarray analysis, nine candidate miRNAs the levels of which were markedly decreased in post-operative plasma were selected for further studies. After confirmation of their post-operative marked reduction, two candidate miRNAs, miR-451 and miR-486, were selected as plasma biomarkers, considering the abundance in plasma, and marked decrease in post-operative samples. In validation, the two miRNAs were found to decrease in post-operative plasma in 90 and 93% of patients (both P&lt;0.01). In comparison with healthy controls, the levels of both miRNAs were found to be significantly higher in patients, and the area under the curve values were high at 0.96 and 0.92. Plasma miR-451 and miR-486 could be useful blood-based biomarkers for screening GC.
