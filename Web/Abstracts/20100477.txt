MiRNA-26b regulates the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in desferrioxamine-treated CNE cells. Here we report that miR-26b is involved in COX-2 overexpression in desferrioxamine (DFOM)-treated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal epithelial (CNE) cells. The level of miR-26b in DFOM-treated CNE cells is inversely proportional to the expression level of the COX-2 protein. Overexpression of miR-26b in DFOM-treated CNE cells inhibits cell proliferation. A luciferase reporter gene experiment suggests that the 3' untranslated region of COX-2 carries a binding site for miR-26b. Overexpression of miR-26b marginally reduces the levels of COX-2 protein in DFOM-treated CNE cells. Moreover, knockdown of COX-2 expression had a similar effect to overexpression of miR-26b. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-26b regulates COX-2 expression in DFOM-treated cells.
