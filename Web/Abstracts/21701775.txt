Identification of novel molecular targets regulated by tumor suppressive miR-1/miR-133a in maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma. Based on our microRNA (miRNA) expression signature analysis of maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma (MSSCC), we found that miR-1 and miR-133a were significantly reduced in tumor tissues. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that the expression levels of miR-1 and miR-133a were significantly downregulated in clinical MSSCC tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. We focused on the functional significance of miR-1 and miR-133a in cancer cells and identification of the novel cancer networks regulated by these miRNAs in MSSCC. Restoration of downregulated miRNAs (miR-1 or miR-133a) in cancer cells revealed that both miRNAs significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Molecular target identification of these miRNAs showed that transgelin 2 (TAGLN2) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) were regulated by miR-1 and miR-133a. Both TAGLN2 and PNP mRNA expression levels were significantly upregulated in clinical MSSCC tumor tissues. Silencing studies of target genes demonstrated that both genes inhibited cancer cell proliferation. The identification of novel miR-1/miR-133a-regulated cancer pathways could provide new insights into potential molecular mechanisms of MSSCC oncogenesis.
