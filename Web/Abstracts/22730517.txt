Thyrotropin Regulates Thyroid Cell Proliferation by Up-Regulating miR-23b and miR-29b that Target SMAD3. Context:MicroRNA (miRNA or miR) have emerged as an important class of short endogenous RNA that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and have a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation.Objectives:The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of miRNA in the proliferation of differentiated thyroid cells that require TSH for their growth.Design:To elucidate the role of miRNA in thyroid cell proliferation, we have analyzed the miRNA expression profile of PC Cl 3 cells before and after the stimulation by TSH.Results:We report the identification of two specific miRNA (miR-23b and miR-29b) whose up-regulation by TSH is required for thyroid cell growth. We identified mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3), a member of the TGF- pathway that has an inhibitor role in thyroid follicular cell proliferation as a target of miR-23b and miR-29b. Functional studies demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-23b and miR-29b promotes thyroid cell growth. Interestingly, an increased expression of both these miRNA was also detected in experimental and human goiters.Conclusions:These findings support the idea that the regulation of miRNA expression synergizes with the traditional proliferation pathways in promoting cell growth.
