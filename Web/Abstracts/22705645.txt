Suppression of Akt/Foxp3-mediated miR-183 expression blocks Sp1-mediated ADAM17 expression and TNF-mediated NFB activation in piceatannol-treated human leukemia U937 cells. To address the mechanism of piceatannol in inhibiting TNF-mediated pathway, studies on piceatannol-treated human leukemia U937 cells were conducted. Piceatannol treatment reduced TNF shedding and NFB activation and decreased the release of soluble TNF into the culture medium of U937 cells. Moreover, ADAM17 expression was down-regulated in piceatannol-treated cells. Over-expression of ADAM17 abrogated the ability of piceatannol to suppress TNF-mediated NFB activation. Piceatannol-evoked -TrCP up-regulation promoted Sp1 degradation, thus reducing transcriptional level of ADAM17 gene in U937 cells. Piceatannol treatment induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation but inactivation of Akt and ERK. In contrast to p38 MAPK inhibitor or restoration of ERK activation, transfection of constitutive active Akt abolished the effect of piceatannol on -TrCP, Sp1 and ADAM17 expression. Piceatannol-elicited down-regulation of miR-183 expression was found to cause -TrCP up-regulation. Inactivation of Akt resulted in Foxp3 down-regulation and reduced miR-183 expression in piceatannol-treated cells. Knock-down of Foxp3 and chromatin immunoprecipitating revealed that Foxp3 genetically regulated transcription of miR-183 gene. Taken together, our data indicate that suppression of Akt/Foxp3-mediated miR-183 expression blocks Sp1-mediated ADAM17 expression in piceatannol-treated U937 cells. Consequently, piceatannol suppresses TNF shedding, leading to inhibition of TNF/NFB pathway.
