Down regulation of c-Myc and induction of an angiogenesis inhibitor, thrombospondin-1, by 5-FU in human colon cancer KM12C cells. 5-FU is commonly used for treatment of various solid tumors including colon carcinoma. We have previously demonstrated that Egr-1 induced by 5-FU enhanced TSP-1 expression in human colon cancer KM12C cells. In this study, a Genechip analysis of KM12C cells treated with 5-FU revealed down-regulation of 924 genes and up-regulation of 460 genes. The decreased expression of c-Myc mRNA and phosphorylated c-Myc were detected and confirmed by RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Since 5-FU induced the expression of TSP-1, we examined the effect of c-Myc on the TSP-1 promoter. Deletion of the TSP-1 promoter region in which binding sites for c-Myc reside had no effect on the TSP-1 promoter activity induced by 5-FU. Meanwhile, 5-FU dose-dependently decreased the expression of miR-17-92 cluster. These findings suggest that 5-FU decreased the expression of c-Myc and consequently miR-17-92 cluster and increased the expression of TSP-1 mRNA.
