Control of HIV infection: escape from the shadow of Blimp-1. Prior murine studies have demonstrated the pivotal role that Blimp-1 has in the exhausted phenotype of T lymphocytes in chronic viral infection. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, Seddiki et al. [Eur. J. Immunol. 2013. 43: 510-520] demonstrate the applicability of this research to HIV infection. The authors do so by demonstrating differences in Blimp-1 expression between T lymphocytes isolated from patients with chronic active HIV versus those from long-term nonprogressors and showing that this is matched by differences in the cells' capacity to produce IL-2 and the level of expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1. The data presented here suggest that this may relate to differential regulation of Blimp-1 by the micro RNA, mIR-9. These findings complement current murine work and fit squarely within the research priorities, as outlined by the International AIDS Society, for determining a cure for AIDS.
