[Inhibitory effect of knocking down microRNA-221 and microRNA-222 on glioma cell growth in vitro and in vivo]. To study the inhibitory effect of knocking down microRNA(miR)-221 and miR-222 on human glioma cell growth and its possible mechanism. miRNA-221/222 antisense oligonucleotides (antisense miR221/222) were transfected into human glioma U251 cells by lipofectamine. Northern blot analysis was conducted to detect the mRNA expression of miR-221/222 in the control and transfected cell groups. The proliferation activity of cells was determined by MTT assay. Cell invasion ability was examined by transwell assay, and cell cycle kinetics and apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry. The expression of relevant proteins was analyzed by Western blotting. The therapeutic efficacy of antisense miR221/222 on the growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice were also observed. In the antisense miR-221/222-transfected cells, the expression of miR-221/222 was significantly reduced; the cell invasion ability was suppressed, cell cycle was blocked at G(0)/G(1) phase, and apoptotic cells were increased. The growth of xenograft tumors treated with antisense miR-221/222 was also inhibited. In antisense miR-221/222 treated tumor cells, the expression of bcl-2 was down-regulated while connexin43, p27, PUMA, caspase-3, PTEN, TIMP3 and Bax up-regulated, and p53 expression not changed. There is a significant inhibitory effect of antisense miR-221/222 on the growth of human glioma U251 cells. miR-221/222 may be considered as a candidate target for gene therapy of human gliomas.
