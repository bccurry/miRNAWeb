Induction of growth arrest by miR-542-3p that targets survivin. Survivin is a protein which functions as a mitotic regulator as well as apoptosis inhibitor. In this study, we show that introduction of synthetic miR-542-3p mimetic reduced both mRNA and protein levels of survivin. In A549 cells, luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-542-3p targeted predicted binding sites in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of survivin. We also demonstrate that ectopic expression of miR-542-3p inhibited cell proliferation by inducing Gap 1 (G1) and Gap 2/Mitosis (G2/M) cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these results suggest that survivin is a direct target of miR-542-3p and growth inhibition by miR-542-3p may have a potential utility as an anti-cancer therapy.
