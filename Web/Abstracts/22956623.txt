MicroRNA hsa-let-7g targets lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 expression and inhibits apoptosis in human smooth muscle cells. Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) has been identified as a major receptor for oxidatively modified low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Very few studies have reported regulation of LOX-1 expression by microRNAs in SMCs. The present study demonstrates that the microRNA hsa-let-7g can inhibit LOX-1 expression in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, and subsequently inhibit ox-LDL uptake in and proliferation of human aortic SMCs. We also show that hsa-let-7g can reduce SMC apoptosis by down-regulation of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo and upregulation of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, we show that hsa-let-7g reduces ox-LDL-induced increase in the expression of NADPH oxidase (p22(phox) and p47(phox) subunits) and subsequent intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappaB p65 expression. These observations suggest that hsa-let-7g is a critical regulator of SMC apoptosis, and may be suitable for therapeutic intervention in disease states characterized by LOX-1 over-expression.
