The RNA-binding protein HuR opposes the repression of ERBB-2 gene expression by microRNA miR-331-3p in prostate cancer cells. ERBB-2 overexpression is associated with the development and progression of cancer and mediates its resistance to therapy. It has been suggested that post-transcriptional mechanisms control the overexpression of ERBB-2 in prostate cancer (PCa). We recently demonstrated that the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of ERBB-2 mRNA contains two specific target sites for binding of the microRNA miR-331-3p and that miR-331-3p represses ERBB-2 expression and signaling in PCa cells. Here we investigate a U-rich element situated in close proximity to the distal miR-331-3p target site in the ERBB-2 3'-UTR. Specific binding of HuR to this U-rich element promotes ERBB-2 expression in PCa cells. We show that HuR antagonizes the repressive action of miR-331-3p on its distal ERBB-2 3'-UTR target site. These results support a model in which the interplay between RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs controls the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and suggest that both HuR and miR-331-3p participate in the overexpression of ERBB-2 observed in some PCas.
