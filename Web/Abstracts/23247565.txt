MiR-143 is not essential for adipose development as revealed by in vivo antisense targeting. MiR-143 plays an important role in promoting the adipogenic differentiation of pre-adipocytes. Here, we report that systematic silencing of miR-143 in mice by using a locked-nucleic-acid-modified oligonucleotide (LNA-antimiR) did not lead to any obvious abnormalities in the adipose tissue differentiation. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the expression level of several adipogenic marker genes, such as PPAR and C/EBP, in these animals compared with the controls. Therefore, we hypothesize that miR-143 may function as a fine tuning molecule rather than as a switch in the adipogenic regulatory network in mice. In addition, the proposed miR-143 target, ERK5, which was previously identified in human preadipocytes, was not effectively inhibited by miR-143 either in the murine preadipocyte cell line, 3T3-L1, or in primary mouse adipose tissue. However, we did fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) was identified as a target of miR-143 in murine adipogenesis.
