Evolution of coding and non-coding genes in HOX clusters of a marsupial. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The HOX gene clusters are thought to be highly conserved amongst mammals and othervertebrates, but the long non-coding RNAs have only been studied in detail in human andmouse. The sequencing of the kangaroo genome provides an opportunity to use comparativeanalyses to compare the HOX clusters of a mammal with a distinct body plan to those ofother mammals. RESULTS: Here we report a comparative analysis of HOX gene clusters between an Australian marsupialof the kangaroo family and the eutherians. There was a strikingly high level of conservationof HOX gene sequence and structure and non-protein coding genes including the microRNAsmiRNA-196a, miRNA-196b, miRNA-10a and miRNA-10b and the long non-coding RNAsHOTAIR, HOTAIRM1 and HOXA11AS that play critical roles in regulating gene expressionand controlling development. By microRNA deep sequencing and comparative genomicanalyses, two conserved microRNAs (miR-10a and miR-10b) were identified and one newcandidate microRNA with typical hairpin precursor structure that is expressed in bothfibroblasts and testes was found. The prediction of microRNA target analysis showed thatseveral known microRNA targets, such as mir-10, mir-414 and mir-464, were found in thetammar HOX clusters. In addition, several novel and putative miRNAs were identified thatoriginated from elsewhere in the tammar genome and that target the tammar HOXB andHOXD clusters. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the emergence of known long non-coding RNAs in the HOXclusters clearly predate the marsupial-eutherian divergence 160 Ma ago. It also identified anew potentially functional microRNA as well as conserved miRNAs. These non-codingRNAs may participate in the regulation of HOX genes to influence the body plan of thismarsupial.
