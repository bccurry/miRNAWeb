[Effect of miR-221-specific inhibitor on the proliferation and apoptosis of human colorectal carcinoma cells]. To investigate miRNA-221 expression in human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells and the effects of miR-221-specific inhibitor on the proliferation and apoptosis of CRC cells. Four human CRC cell lines (HT-29, Lovo, SW-480, and CaCO2) were examined for miRNA-221 expression using real-time Q-PCR. The specific 2,-methoxy-modified RNA oligonucleotides of miR-221 (anti-miR-221) were synthesized and transfected into Caco2 cells via liposome, and the changes in the expression of miR-221 in the cells were detected by real-time Q-PCR. The proliferation and apoptosis of the transfected CRC cells were detected using MTT assay and flow cytometry. The 4 human CRC cells showed significantly upregulated expression of miR-221 compare with HUVECs (P&lt;0.01). The miR-221-specific inhibitor, anti-miR-221, significantly inhibited the expression of miR-221 in Caco2 cells and suppressed the cell proliferation, causing also obvious cell apoptosis (P&lt;0.01). The miR-221-specific inhibitor shows potent inhibitory effect on the growth of CRC cells, suggesting its value as a potential anti-tumor candidate for treatment of CRC.
