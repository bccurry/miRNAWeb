miR-155 and its star-form partner miR-155* cooperatively regulate type I interferon production by human plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The recent discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) has revealed a new layer of gene expression regulation, affecting the immune system. Here, we identify their roles in regulating human plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC) activation. miRNA profiling showed the significantly differential expression of 19 miRNAs in PDCs after Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) stimulation, among which miR-155* and miR-155 were the most highly induced. Although they were processed from a single precursor and were both induced by TLR7 through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, miR-155* and miR-155 had opposite effects on the regulation of type I interferon production by PDC. Further study indicated that miR-155* augmented interferon-/ expression by suppressing IRAKM, whereas miR-155 inhibited their expression by targeting TAB2. Kinetic analysis of miR-155* and miR-155 induction revealed that miR-155* was mainly induced in the early stage of stimulation, and that miR-155 was mainly induced in the later stage, suggesting their cooperative involvement in PDC activation. Finally, we demonstrated that miR-155* and miR-155 were inversely regulated by autocrine/paracrine type I interferon and TLR7-activated KHSRP at the posttranscriptional level, which led to their different dynamic induction by TLR7. Thus, our study identified and validated novel miRNA-protein networks involved in regulating PDC activation.
