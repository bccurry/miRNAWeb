A polymorphism of microRNA196a genome region was associated with decreased risk of glioma in Chinese population. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Aberrant expression and structural alternation of miRNAs are considered to participate in tumorigenesis and cancer development. Recently, different genotypes of miR-196a polymorphisms (SNP, rs11614913) were found to be associated with the survival of patients with lung cancer and increased risk of breast cancer. To further investigate whether this polymorphism may influence glioma risk or not, we examined the SNP allele frequency in Chinese population. Our data shows the genotype CC of miR-196a (rs11614913) polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of glioma in the Chinese population (OR = 0.74, 95% CI:0.56-0.98). Furthermore, a significant association was observed between this genotype and glioma risk in the subgroups of adult glioma (OR = 0.73, 95% CI:0.55-0.98), male glioma (OR = 0.69, 95% CI:0.48-0.99) and patients with glioblastoma (OR = 0.58, 95% CI:0.37-0.91). This was the first study investigating the association between the miR-196a rs11614913 and glioma risk. Compared with the results from previous studies in lung cancer and breast cancer, our data suggest a different genotype association in glioma. This may be related to the diversity on the tissue origin, tumor type, tumorigenesis, and developing process.
