[Inhibitory effect of the recombinant adenovirus pre-miR-10a on K562 cell proliferation]. To investigate the changes of proliferation and apoptosis in K562 cells over-expressing miR-10a. K562 cells were infected with pAd-pre-miR-10a virus, and then the levels of miR-10a and bcr/abl in transfected K562 cells was detected using RT-PCR and the level of BCR/ABL using Western blotting. The methylthiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and flow cytometry (FCM) were used to monitor the changes of proliferation and apoptosis of K562 cells after transfection. Compared with the control groups, K562 cells transfected with pAd-pre-miR-10a presented the significantly increased level of miR-10a, the significantly decreased expressions of bcr/abl fusion gene and BCR/ABL fusion protein, the inhibited proliferation ability and the promoted apoptosis (P&lt;0.05). The recombinant adenovirus of pAd-pre-miR-10a can inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells and promote cell apoptosis significantly.
