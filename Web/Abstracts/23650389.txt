Cross-talk between MET and EGFR in non-small cell lung cancer involves miR-27a and Sprouty2. In the past decade, we have observed exciting advances in lung cancer therapy, including the development of targeted therapies. However, additional strategies for early detection and tumor-based therapy are still essential in improving patient outcomes. EGF receptor (EGFR) and MET (the receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factors) are cell-surface tyrosine kinase receptors that have been implicated in diverse cellular processes and as regulators of several microRNAs (miRNAs), thus contributing to tumor progression. Here, we demonstrate a biological link between EGFR, MET, and the miRNA cluster 23a ~ 27a ~ 24-2. We show that miR-27a regulates MET, EGFR, and Sprouty2 in lung cancer. In addition, we identify both direct and indirect mechanisms by which miR-27a can regulate both MET and EGFR. Thus, we propose a mechanism for MET and EGFR axis regulation that may lead to the development of therapeutics in lung cancer.
