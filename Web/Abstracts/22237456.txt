Circulating microRNA-218 was reduced in cervical cancer and correlated with tumor invasion. microRNA-218 was proved to be a tumor-suppressor microRNA in several cancers, but its status in cervical cancer patients has not been established. In this study, we investigated the expression of microRNA-218 in the sera from cervical cancer patients and its relationships with clinico-pathological characteristics. The expression of microRNA-218 was detected in the sera of 90 cervical cancer patients and 50 normal age-matched women by quantitative real-time PCR. The clinical data were collected and analyzed by statistical software. In the cancer group, microRNA-218 was reduced significantly in the sera (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, decreased microRNA-218 was associated with later stages, cervical adenocarcinoma, and lymphatic node metastasis. microRNA-218 was deregulated in most cervical cancer patients and associated with tumor invasion.
