[Abnormal expression and significance of MIR-184 in human renal carcinoma]. To explore the role of microRNA-184(MIR-184) in the development of renal cell carcinoma(RCC). The expressions of MIR-184 in 51 patients with RCC Investigated, normal adjacent tissues (ADTs) matched by fluorescence quantitative PCR technology (RT-qPCR) and the correlations analyzed between MIR-184 expression and the age, gender and clinical stage of RCC patients. The average expression of MIR-184 in RCC was -14.664 6  5.362 4, while that in ADTs was -10.408 7  3.482 7(P&lt;0.01). Bounded with the MIR-184 expression in RCC, patients were divided into lower-expression group and higher-expression group. Meanwhile, the RCC patients were divided into three groups according to the age, gender and clinical stage of the patients. Chi-square statistical analysis showed that the expression level of MIR-184 was not significantly correlated with the patient's age, gender and clinical stage (respectively: P&gt;0.03, P&gt;0.99, P&gt;0.03). MIR-184 in RCC was significantly lower than that in ADTs, which may have potential significance in the occurrence and development of RCC.
