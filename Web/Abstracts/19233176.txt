Regulation of chondrocytic phenotype by micro RNA 18a: involvement of Ccn2/Ctgf as a major target gene. We searched for miRNAs that were down-regulated in chondrocytic cells and predicted to target CCN2/connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF) that promotes endochondral ossification. Among them, expression of miR-18a was most strongly repressed in chondrocytic cells. Reporter gene analysis confirmed the functionality of an miR-18a target in the 3'-untranslated region of Ccn2 mRNA, which was predicted in silico. Indeed, introduction of miR-18a efficiently repressed the CCN2 production from chondrocytic cells. Finally, transfected miR-18a significantly repressed the mature chondrocytic phenotype. Our present study revealed a regulatory role for miR-18a in chondrocytic differentiation through CCN2.
