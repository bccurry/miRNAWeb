miR-23a inhibits E-cadherin expression and is regulated by AP-1 and NFAT4 complex during Fas-induced EMT in gastrointestinal cancer. Fas signaling has been shown to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote gastrointestinal (GI) cancer metastasis, but the involvement of miRNA in this mechanism remains unknown. We found that FasL treatment inhibited E-cadherin expression and promoted cell invasion by upregulation of miR-23a, but overexpression of the miR-23a inhibitor could partially block this activity. FasL-induced ERK/MAPK signaling activated the AP-1 complex and repressed GSK-3 activity, which contributed to nuclear translocation of AP-1 and NFAT4. Nuclear accumulation and interaction of AP-1 and NFAT4 and subsequent binding to the miR-23a promoter led to increased miR-23a expression. Inhibition of Fas signaling by downregulation of the Fas receptor led to a decrease in miR-23a expression and cell invasion ability in vivo and in vitro, as well as an increase in E-cadherin. Evaluation of human GI precancerous and cancer specimens showed that the expression of FasL and miR-23a increased while E-cadherin decreased during GI cancer progression. A significant correlation was noted between any two of these three molecules. An EMT-phenotype was shown to correlate with an advanced cancer stage and worse prognosis. Taken together, our results show that miR-23a participates in the mechanism of the FasL-induced EMT process, and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for cancer metastasis.
