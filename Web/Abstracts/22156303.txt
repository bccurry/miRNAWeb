MicroRNAs in Metabolism and Metabolic Diseases. Aberrant cholesterol/lipid homeostasis is linked to a number of diseases prevalent in the developed world, including metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. We have previously uncovered gene regulatory mechanisms of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) family of transcription factors, which control the expression of genes involved in cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis and uptake. Intriguingly, we recently discovered conserved microRNAs (miR-33a/b) embedded within intronic sequences of the human SREBF genes that act in a concerted manner with their host gene products to regulate cholesterol/lipid homeostasis. Indeed, miR-33a/b control the levels of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCA1, a cholesterol efflux pump critical for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) synthesis and reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues. Importantly, antisense inhibition of miR-33 in mice results in elevated HDL and decreased atherosclerosis. Interestingly, miR-33a/b also act in the fatty acid/lipid homeostasis pathway by controlling the fatty acid -oxidation genes carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (CROT), hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A-dehydrogenase (HADHB), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), as well as the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK1), the NAD(+)-dependent sirtuin SIRT6, and the insulin signaling intermediate IRS2, key regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism. These results have revealed a highly integrated microRNA (miRNA)-host gene circuit governing cholesterol/lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in mammals that may have important therapeutic implications for the treatment of cardiometabolic disorders.
