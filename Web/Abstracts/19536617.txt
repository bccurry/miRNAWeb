Expression profiling of micro-RNAs in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using RT-PCR. To develop novel therapeutic and diagnostic methods for esophageal cancer, it is important to understand the precise biological mechanism. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) seem to be crucial factors in diverse regulation pathways. In this study, we analyzed the expression of mature miRNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The expression of 73 miRNAs was quantified by qRT-PCR in 30 primary ESCC specimens. We examined the correlation between miRNA expressions and the clinicopathological factors and prognosis of ESCC. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the high expression levels of 6 of the 72 miRNAs correlated with significantly lower patient survival rates. The overexpression of miR-129 was identified as a significant and independent prognostic factor (P = 0.031) in surgically treated ESCC patients. The hazard ratio for the prediction of early death was 18.11 for high versus low expression levels of miR-129. Similar results were obtained from an analysis performed on an additional 19 patients (test cohort) (P = 0.0057, for training cohort; P = 0.011, for test cohort; log-rank test). This experiment supports the notion that the high miR-129 expression levels, as observed in this study, might play a important role in the development of esophageal cancer.
