Dysregulation of miRNA146a versus IRAK1 induces IL-17 persistence in the psoriatic skin lesions. Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder with dysregulation of miRNAs. The expression pattern of miR-146a and target gene IRAK1 in lesions and PBMCs of plaque psoriasis remains unclear. In our study, we found the expression of miR-146a was up-regulated both in lesions and PBMCs of psoriatic patients, and positively correlated with IL-17 expression, whereas the target gene IRAK1 expression was expressed differentially in lesions and peripheral blood. Inability of miR-146a inhibiting target gene IRAK1 may contribute to the persistent inflammation in lesions of psoriasis.
