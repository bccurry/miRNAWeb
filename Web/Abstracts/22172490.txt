miR-375 is highly expressed and possibly transactivated by achaete-scute complex homolog 1 in small-cell lung cancer cells. In this study, we identified five miRNAs highly expressed in the small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line NCI-H209. Among them, the expression levels of miR-375 were dramatically elevated in all SCLC cell lines examined, coincident with the expression of the transcription factor achaete-scute complex homolog 1 (ASCL1). Moreover, miR-375 was upregulated and correlated with ASCL1 in the cell lines generated from mouse SCLC-like tumors as well. Dual-luciferase assays further showed that ASCL1 activated the expression of miR-375 by binding to the three E-box elements in the miR-375 promoter. These results imply a role of ASCL1 in SCLC via the upregulation of miR-375.
