1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 modulates lipid metabolism in prostate cancer cells through miRNA mediated regulation of PPARA. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that testosterone (T) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) co-operate to inhibit cell proliferation and induce significant changes in gene expression and differentiation in LNCaP cells. The data presented here demonstrate that the two agents alter fatty acid metabolism, and accumulation of neutral lipid. Concurrent genome wide analysis of mRNA and miRNA in LNCaP cells reveals an extensive transcription regulatory network modulated by T and 1,25(OH)2D3. This involves not only androgen receptor (AR)- and vitamin D receptor (VDR)-mediated transcription, but also transcription factors E2F1- and c-Myc-dependent transcription. Changes in the activities of these transcription factors alter the steady state levels of several miRNAs, including the miR-17/92 cluster. These changes correlate with the up-regulation of the mRNA encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) and its downstream targets, leading to increased lipogenesis. These data suggest that the coordinated effect of T and 1,25(OH)2D3 in prostate cancer cells increases lipogenesis, diverting energy away from Warburg-based tumor energy metabolism, which slows or halts cell growth and tumor progression.
