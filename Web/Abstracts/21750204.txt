Molecular Characteristics of ERCC1-Negative versus ERCC1-Positive Tumors in Resected NSCLC. Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) is a protein involved in repair of DNA platinum adducts and stalled DNA replication forks. We and others have previously shown the influence of ERCC1 expression upon survival rates and benefit of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, little is known about the molecular characteristics of ERCC1-positive and ERCC1-negative tumors. We took advantage of a cohort of 91 patients with resected NSCLC, for which we had matched frozen and paraffin-embedded samples to explore the comparative molecular portraits of ERCC1-positive and ERCC1-negative tumors of NSCLC. We carried out a global molecular analysis including assessment of ERCC1 expression levels by using both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), genomic instability, global gene and miRNA expression, and sequencing of selected key genes involved in lung carcinogenesis. ERCC1 protein and mRNA expression were significantly correlated. However, we observed several cases with clear discrepancies. We noted that ERCC1-negative tumors had a higher rate of genomic abnormalities versus ERCC1-positive tumors. ERCC1-positive tumors seemed to share a common DNA damage response (DDR) phenotype with the overexpression of seven genes linked to DDR. The miRNA expression analysis identified miR-375 as significantly underexpressed in ERCC1-positive tumors. Our data show inconsistencies in ERCC1 expression between IHC and qRT-PCR readouts. Furthermore, ERCC1 status is not linked to specific mutational patterns or frequencies. Finally, ERCC1-negative tumors have a high rate of genomic aberrations that could consequently influence prognosis in patients with resected NSCLC.
