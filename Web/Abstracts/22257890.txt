Pre-microRNA binding aminoglycosides and antitumor drugs as inhibitors of Dicer catalyzed microRNA processing. Over-expressions of miRNAs are being increasingly linked with many diseases including different types of cancer. In this study, the role of some known small molecular therapeutics has been investigated for their ability to bind with the pre-miRNA target (hsa-mir-155) and thereby to interfere with the Dicer catalyzed miRNA processing. Potential binding and inhibition effects have been demonstrated by some of these analogs. They can be used as leads for further development of potent small molecular miRNA-antagonists.
