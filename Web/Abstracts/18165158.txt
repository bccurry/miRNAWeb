Genome-wide computational analyses of microRNAs and their targets from Canis familiaris. By computational analyses, we identified 357 miRNA candidates from Canis familiaris genome, among which 300 are homology of characterized human miRNAs, the remains are not reported in any other animal. Of the 357 miRNA genes, 142 are organized into 53 clusters, and two clusters locate in the paternally imprinted region. These dog miRNAs may regulate more than 800 possible targets, which are involved in a wide range of cellular processes. Remarkably, miR-186 resides in the eighth intron of its target gene in the same orientation, suggesting a feedback regulation of miRNA on its host gene.
