MicroRNA-29a regulates pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and scavenger receptor expression by targeting LPL in oxLDL-stimulated dendritic cells. There is increasing evidence that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation that accompany inflammatory responses. However, whether microRNAs are associated with DC immuno-inflammatory responses with oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) stimulation is not yet known. Our study aims to explore the link of miRNAs with lipid-overload and immuno-inflammatory mechanism for atherosclerosis. In DCs transfected with microRNA-29a mimics or inhibitors, we showed that microRNA-29a plays an important role in proinflammatory cytokine secretion and scavenger receptor expression upon oxLDL-treatment. Furthermore, we suggest an additional explanation for the mechanism of microRNA-29a regulation of its functional target, lipoprotein lipase. We conclude that microRNA-29a could regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and scavenger receptor expression by targeting lipoprotein lipase in oxLDL-stimulated dendritic cells.
