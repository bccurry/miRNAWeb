MicroRNA-30e* promotes human glioma cell invasiveness in an orthotopic xenotransplantation model by disrupting the NF-B/IB negative feedback loop. Constitutive activation of NF-B is a frequent event in human cancers, playing important roles in cancer development and progression. In nontransformed cells, NF-B activation is tightly controlled by IBs. IBs bind NF-B in the cytoplasm, preventing it from translocating to the nucleus to modulate gene expression. Stimuli that activate NF-B signaling trigger IB degradation, enabling nuclear translocation of NF-B. Among the genes regulated by NF-B are those encoding the IBs, providing a negative feedback loop that limits NF-B activity. How transformed cells override this NF-B/IB negative feedback loop remains unclear. Here, we report in human glioma cell lines that microRNA-30e* (miR-30e*) directly targets the IB 3-UTR and suppresses IB expression. Overexpression of miR-30e* in human glioma cell lines led to hyperactivation of NF-B and enhanced expression of NF-B-regulated genes, which promoted glioma cell invasiveness in in vitro assays and in an orthotopic xenotransplantation model. These effects of miR-30e* were shown to be clinically relevant, as miR-30e* was found to be upregulated in primary human glioma cells and correlated with malignant progression and poor survival. Hence, miR-30e* provides an epigenetic mechanism that disrupts the NF-B/IB loop and may represent a new therapeutic target and prognostic marker.
