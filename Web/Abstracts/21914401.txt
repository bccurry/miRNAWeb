[DNA methylation of microRNA-34b/c and microRNA-124a in gastric cancer]. To explore the effects of DNA methylation of microRNA (miRNA) gene on their expressions in patients with gastric carcinoma. A total of 80 subjects were divided into gastric carcinoma group (n = 40) and control group (n = 40). The DNA methylation status of miRNA-34b/c and miRNA-124a gene promoters was detected by DNA methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) in gastric carcinoma tissues and normal mucosal tissues. The positive rate of DNA methylation of miRNA-34b/c gene promoter was 77.5% (31/40) and 5.0% (2/40) in gastric carcinoma and control groups respectively. There was statistically significant difference between two groups (P &lt; 0.05). The positive rate of DNA methylation of miRNA-124a gene promoter was 60.0% (24/40) and 0 in these two groups respectively. There was statistically significant difference between two groups (P &lt; 0.05). Also the hypermethylation positivity of gene promoter of miRNAs was correlated with the clinicopathological features of gastric carcinoma. The hypermethylation of miRNA-34b/c and miRNA-124a gene promoters may play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of gastric carcinoma.
