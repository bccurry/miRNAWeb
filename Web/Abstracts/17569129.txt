Detection of let-7a microRNA by real-time PCR in gastric carcinoma. To establish an accurate and rapid stem-loop reverse transcriptional real-time PCR (RT-PCR) method to quantify human let-7a miRNA in gastric cancer. According to the sequence of let-7a miRNA, the stem-loop reverse transcriptional primer, the primers and quantitative MGB probes of real-time PCR were designed and synthesized. The dynamic range and the sensitivity of quantitative reverse transcriptional real-time PCR were determined. The levels of let-7a miRNA were examined in 32 gastric carcinoma samples by stem-loop RT-PCR method. The dynamic range and sensitivity of the let-7a miRNA quantification scheme were evaluated, the result showed the assay could precisely detect 10 copies of mature let-7a miRNA in as few as 0.05 ng of total RNA of gastric mucosa. The results of specificity analysis showed no fluorescence signal occurred even though 50 ng of human genomic DNA was added to the reverse transcription (RT) reaction. The expression level of let-7a miRNA in gastric tumor tissues was significantly lower compared to normal tissues in 14 samples from 32 patients. The stem-loop RT-PCR is a reliable method to detect let-7a miRNA which may play an important role in the development of gastric carcinoma.
