Clinicopathologic significance of miR-10b expression in gastric carcinoma. We have investigated microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of gastric cancer and the clinicopathologic significance of miR-10b expression in gastric carcinoma. miRCURY LNA Arrays (v.16.0; Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) were used to screen miRNAs in 17 gastric cancers. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the expression of miR-10b in 56 gastric tumors. Expression of miR-10b in 436 paraffin-embedded cancer tissues was also investigated. In gastric cancer, 49 miRNAs were overexpressed by 2.0-fold or greater, and 39 miRNAs were down-regulated by 1.5-fold or greater, whereas miR-10b was up-regulated by 2.98-fold. miR-10b was highly expressed in gastric cancer and correlated with size of tumor, Lauren classification, depth of invasion, lymph node and distant metastasis, TNM stage, and prognosis. In stages I, II, and III, the 5-year survival rate of patients with high levels of miR-10b expression was significantly lower than that in patients with low levels of expression. In stage IV, the expression level of miR-10b did not correlate with the 5-year survival rate. miR-10b may play an important role in progression and prognosis of gastric cancer.
