Down-regulated expression of hsa-miR-181c in Fanconi anemia patients: implications in TNF regulation and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited genetic disorder associated with BM failure and cancer predisposition. In the present study, we sought to elucidate the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the hematopoietic defects observed in FA patients. Initial studies showed that 3 miRNAs, hsa-miR-133a, hsa-miR-135b, and hsa-miR-181c, were significantly down-regulated in lymphoblastoid cell lines and fresh peripheral blood cells from FA patients. In vitro studies with cells expressing the luciferase reporter fused to the TNF 3'-untranslated region confirmed in silico predictions suggesting an interaction between hsa-miR-181c and TNF mRNA. These observations were consistent with the down-regulated expression of TNF mediated by hsa-miR-181c in cells from healthy donors and cells from FA patients. Because of the relevance of TNF in the hematopoietic defects of FA patients, in the present study, we transfected BM cells from FA patients with hsa-miR-181c to evaluate the impact of this miRNA on their clonogenic potential. hsa-miR-181c markedly increased the number and size of the myeloid and erythroid colonies generated by BM cells from FA patients. Our results offer new clues toward understanding the biologic basis of BM failure in FA patients and open new possibilities for the treatment of the hematologic dysfunction in FA patients based on miRNA regulation.
