Correcting miR-15a/16 genetic defect in New Zealand Black mouse model of CLL enhances drug sensitivity. Alterations in the human 13q14 genomic region containing microRNAs mir-15a and mir-16-1 are present in most human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have previously found the development of CLL in the New Zealand Black murine model to be associated with a point mutation in the primary mir-15a/16-1 region, which correlated with a decrease in mature miR-16 and miR-15a levels. In this study, addition of exogenous miR-15a and miR-16 led to an accumulation of cells in G(1) in non-New Zealand Black B cell and New Zealand Black-derived malignant B-1 cell lines. However, the New Zealand Black line had significantly greater G(1) accumulation, suggesting a restoration of cell cycle control upon exogenous miR-15a/16 addition. Our experiments showed a reduction in protein levels of cyclin D1, a miR-15a/16 target and cell cycle regulator of G(1)/S transition, in the New Zealand Black cell line following miR-15a/16 addition. These microRNAs were shown to directly target the cyclin D1 3' untranslated region using a green fluorescent protein lentiviral expression system. miR-16 was also shown to augment apoptosis induction by nutlin, a mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) antagonist, and genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, when added to a B-1 cell line derived from multiple in vivo passages of malignant B-1 cells from New Zealand Black mice with CLL. miR-16 synergized with nutlin and genistein to induce apoptosis. Our data support a role for the mir-15a/16-1 cluster in cell cycle regulation and suggest that these mature microRNAs in both the New Zealand Black model and human CLL may be targets for therapeutic efficacy in this disease.
