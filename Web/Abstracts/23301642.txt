[Molecular basis of Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia]. Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia is a rare lymphoproliferative disease that is currently classified into lymphomas with incidence of 3 cases per million. This disease comprises about 1-2% of hematological malignancies and is characterized by infiltration of malignant B cells into the bone marrow and presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin IgM in serum. WM is still an incurable disease with median survival of 5 years. Molecular basis of this disease remains unclear even though deletion of 6q, trisomy of chromosomes 4 and 8, deletion of 13q and increased expression of IL-6 seem to be typical for this disease. The most important changes of microRNA are increased expression of miR-155 and decreased expression of miR-9*. This work aims to describe current knowledge about the molecular basis of this disease.
