Active stabilization of human endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA by hnRNP E1 protects against antisense RNA and microRNAs. Human endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA is highly stable in endothelial cells (ECs). Posttranscriptional regulation of eNOS mRNA stability is an important component of eNOS regulation, especially under hypoxic conditions. Here, we show that the human eNOS 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) contains multiple, evolutionarily conserved pyrimidine (C and CU)-rich sequence elements that are both necessary and sufficient for mRNA stabilization. Importantly, RNA immunoprecipitations and RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed the formation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 (hnRNP E1)-containing RNP complexes at these 3'-UTR elements. Knockdown of hnRNP E1 decreased eNOS mRNA half-life, mRNA levels, and protein expression. Significantly, these stabilizing RNP complexes protect eNOS mRNA from the inhibitory effects of its antisense transcript sONE and 3'-UTR-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), as well as microRNAs, specifically, hsa-miR-765, which targets eNOS mRNA stability determinants. Hypoxia disrupts hnRNP E1/eNOS 3'-UTR interactions via increased Akt-mediated serine phosphorylation (including serine 43) and increased nuclear localization of hnRNP E1. These mechanisms account, at least in part, for the decrease in eNOS mRNA stability under hypoxic conditions. Thus, the stabilization of human eNOS mRNA by hnRNP E1-containing RNP complexes serves as a key protective mechanism against the posttranscriptional inhibitory effects of antisense RNA and microRNAs under basal conditions but is disrupted under hypoxic conditions.
