[HBx gene down-regulates miR-192 expression and inhibits apoptosis of human hepatoma cell line HepG2]. To explore the mechanism by which HBV X gene(HBx) inhibits apoptosis of human hepatoma cell line HepG2 in terms of miRNA. Three cell lines were prepared: HepG2 cells stably transfected with HBx (HepG2/HBx), HepG2 cells stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 (HepG2/pcDNA3.1) and HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry was adopted to measure the apoptosis of these three cells and Taqman fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to examine miR-192 expression. After HepG2 cells was transfected with miR-192, the apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry and the expressions of p53 and PUMA at mRNA and protein levels were evaluated by SYBR Green quantitative PCR and Western blot, respectively. Compared with HepG2/pcDNA3.1 cells (11.46%  0.69%) and HepG2 cells (12.5%  0.66%), the apoptosis rate of HepG2/HBx cells (2.37%  0.35%) was significantly reduced (F = 171.722, P &lt; 0.01). The level of miR-192 was 49.1%  5.9% in HepG2 cells, which was dramatically down-regulated (F = 14.319, P = 0.019) as compared to the other two groups (HepG2/pcDNA3.1: 98.0%  8.9%; HepG2: 100%). Compared with HepG2 cells transfected with miR-NC (10.74%  1.15%), transfection of miR-192 into HepG2 cells led to increased apoptosis (15.74%  1.17%) (F = 18.415, P = 0.013) and higher p53 and PUMA expressions at mRNA (p53: 1.68  0.12 vs 0.90  0.09, F = 43.115, P = 0.003, PUMA: 1.66  0.10 vs 0.98  0.06, F = 22.541, P = 0.009) and protein (p53: 3.07 vs 1, PUMA: 2.13 vs 1) levels. HBx could inhibit apoptosis of HepG2 cells through down-regulation of miR-192 which induces apoptosis of HepG2 cells.
