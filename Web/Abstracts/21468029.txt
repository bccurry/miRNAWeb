microRNA-214 contributes to melanoma tumour progression through suppression of TFAP2C. Malignant melanoma is fatal in its metastatic stage. It is therefore essential to unravel the molecular mechanisms that govern disease progression to metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs involved in tumourigenesis. Using a melanoma progression model, we identified a novel pathway controlled by miR-214 that coordinates metastatic capability. Pathway components include TFAP2C, homologue of a well-established melanoma tumour suppressor, the adhesion receptor ITGA3 and multiple surface molecules. Modulation of miR-214 influences in vitro tumour cell movement and survival to anoikis as well as extravasation from blood vessels and lung metastasis formation in vivo. Considering that miR-214 is known to be highly expressed in human melanomas, our data suggest a critical role for this miRNA in disease progression and the establishment of distant metastases.
