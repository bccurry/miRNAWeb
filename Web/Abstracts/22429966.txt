Aberrant calreticulin expression is involved in the dedifferentiation of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Liposarcomas are a representative group of soft tissue sarcomas with variably hampered adipogenesis, which is most exemplified by its dedifferentiated subtype. However, the factor(s) responsible for inhibiting adipocyte differentiation remains unknown. A recent gene expression profiling study identified several unique genes that were highly expressed in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and the gene encoding calreticulin (CALR), a major Ca(2+)-buffering protein that can inhibit adipocyte differentiation, was found to be overexpressed. Thus, we investigated the expression of calreticulin in 45 cases of liposarcomas, including 15 dedifferentiated tumors, at both the protein and mRNA levels. Immunohistochemically, calreticulin was consistently expressed in the dedifferentiated areas of dedifferentiated liposarcomas and commonly observed in atypical stromal cells and/or lipoblasts in the well-differentiated areas (87%), whereas large vacuolated adipocytic cells in either the tumors or normal fat were essentially negative. These results were further supported by the findings of Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Although abnormalities in 19p13.1-13.2 where CALR is localized were uncommon in the dedifferentiated liposarcomas examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, expression of miR-1257, a putative microRNA that targets calreticulin, was suppressed in the dedifferentiated subtype. The down-regulation of calreticulin by small-interfering RNA could induce adipogenesis in dedifferentiated liposarcoma cells and reduce cell proliferation. Our results therefore suggest that aberrantly expressed calreticulin in dedifferentiated liposarcoma is involved in its dedifferenitation and/or tumor progression.
