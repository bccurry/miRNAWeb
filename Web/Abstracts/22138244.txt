A novel role of miR-302/367 in reprogramming. Ever since the technique of coaxing ordinary skin cells into becoming pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has been developed, which have the potential to become any cell or tissue in the body, efforts were made to improve the approach because some major challenges. Increasing evidence suggests that several microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in early embryonic development and embryonic stem cell formation, known as embryonic stem cell (ESC)-specific miRNAs, particularly the miR-302 family. We summarized here a novel approach to generate iPSCs by using miR-302 and its related miRNAs such as miR-367. The development of this miR-302/367-mediated iPSC (termed mirPSC) may provide tools to deal with the obstacles facing some current iPSC reprogramming methods. The mechanism by which miR-302/367 induce iPSC reprogramming is proposed.
