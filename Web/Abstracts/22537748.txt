Genetic polymorphisms of IL17A and pri-microRNA-938, targeting IL17A 3'-UTR, influence susceptibility to gastric cancer. We report an association between gastric cancer (GC) and polymorphisms in IL17A, rs2275913 (-197 G &gt; A), rs3748067 (*1249 C &gt; T), and pri-miR-938, rs2505901 (T &gt; C). We employed the multiplex PCR-SSCP method to detect gene polymorphisms in 337 GC cases and 587 controls. The minor allele frequency of rs2275913 was significantly higher, and those of rs3748067 and rs2505901 significantly lower, in GC cases than controls. The rs2275913 AA homozygote was associated with an increased risk (OR, 2.38; 95%CI, 1.63-3.46; p &lt; 0.0001) for the development of both intestinal and diffuse types of GC. The rs3748067 T polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk for intestinal GC (OR, 0.511; 95%CI, 0.272-0.962; p = 0.037), whereas rs2505901 C locus carried a decreased risk overall for GC (OR, 0.733; 95%CI, 0.545-0.985; p = 0.039). In addition, rs3748067 T allele was inversely correlated with lymph node metastasis. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in both IL17A and pri-miR-938 contribute to cancer risk susceptibility and therefore can affect the development of gastric cancer.
