Cutting edge: TNF-induced microRNAs regulate TNF-induced expression of E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on human endothelial cells: feedback control of inflammation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) pair with target sequences in the 3' untranslated region of mRNAs to posttranscriptionally repress gene expression. In this study, we report that TNF-mediated induction of endothelial adhesion molecules can be regulated by miRNAs that are induced by TNF. Specifically, E-selectin and ICAM-1 are targets of TNF-induced miRNAs miR-31 and miR-17-3p, respectively. Specific antagonism of these TNF-induced miRNAs increased neutrophil adhesion to cultured endothelial cells. Conversely, transfections with mimics of these miRNAs decreased neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. These data suggest that miRNAs provide negative feedback control of inflammation.
