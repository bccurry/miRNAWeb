Generation of a conditionally replicating adenovirus based on targeted destruction of E1A mRNA by a cell type-specific MicroRNA. MicroRNAs have emerged as important players in tissue-specific mammalian gene regulation and have also been exploited in experimental targeting of gene expression. We have constructed a recombinant adenovirus that contains sequences complementary to the liver-specific microRNA 122 (miR122) in the 3' untranslated region of the E1A gene. In Huh7 cells, which resemble normal hepatocytes in expressing high levels of miR122, this feature resulted in strongly reduced levels of E1A mRNA and protein. This property allowed us to generate a novel recombinant adenovirus that was severely attenuated in cells of hepatic origin but replicated normally in other cells. This strategy may be useful in circumventing liver toxicity associated with the systemic delivery of oncolytic adenoviruses. These data provide the first example of exploiting differential microRNA expression patterns to alter the natural tropism of a DNA virus. In addition, these results suggest that other microRNAs expressed in a tissue- or transformation-specific manner may also be used for the targeting of adenoviral replication and that the same principle may be applied to other viruses that have shown promise as oncolytic or gene delivery platforms.
