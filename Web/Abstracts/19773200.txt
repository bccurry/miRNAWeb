MicroRNAs in Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The molecular genetics of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and its evolution to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) have been widely studied; however, the molecular mechanism of BE-EAC carcinogenesis has not been completely understood. MicroRNA (miRNA) is now essential to understand the molecular mechanism of cancer progression. Recent findings include the following: firstly, miRNA expression profiles can distinguish between BE and EAC; secondly, miR-196a is upregulated in EAC tissues targeting annexin A1, thereby exerting antiapoptotic effects and contributing to EAC cell survival; miR-196a may also constitute a good biomarker of progression during BE-EAC carcinogenesis; and thirdly, The miR-106b-25 polycistron is activated by genomic amplification and is involved in esophageal neoplastic progression and proliferation via the suppression of two target genes, p21 and Bim.
