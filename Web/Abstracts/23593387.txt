Underexpression of miR-34a in hepatocellular carcinoma and its contribution towards enhancement of proliferating inhibitory effects of agents targeting c-MET. Aberrant expression of microRNA-34a (miR-34a) has been reported to be involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of various classes of malignancies. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been completely clarified. In the current study, we have investigated the clinical significance and the in vitro contribution of miR-34a on biological functions of human HCCs. miR-34a expression in eighty-three cases of HCC formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues decreased significantly compared to that in the adjacent liver tissues (P&lt;0.01), as detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). miR-34a expression in the groups of TNM stage I and II, without metastasis and without portal vein tumor embolus, was significantly higher than that of their corresponding groups (P&lt;0.05). In functional experiments, miR-34a mimic suppressed cell growth, migration and invasion, meanwhile it increased cellular apoptosis and caspase activity in HCC cells. miR-34a mimic also reduced phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-stat5 signaling. In addition, miR-34a mimic enhanced the effect of cell proliferation inhibition and caspase activity induction of agents targeting c-MET (siRNAs and small molecular inhibitor su11274). In conclusion, miR-34a may act as a tumor suppressor miRNA of HCC. The strategies to increase miR-34a level might be a critical targeted therapy for HCC in future.
