Characterization and predicted role of the microRNA expression profile in amnion from obese pregnant women. Maternal obesity and nutrient excess in utero increase the risk of future metabolic diseases. The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood, but probably include genetic, epigenetic alterations and changes in fetal nutrient supply. We have studied the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile in amnion from obese and control women at delivery to investigate if a specific miRNA-signature is associated with obesity. The expression profile of 365 human miRNAs was evaluated with the TaqMan Array in amnion from 10 obese and 5 control (pre-pregnancy BMI&gt;30 and &lt;25kg/m(2), respectively) women at delivery. Target genes and miRNA-regulated pathways were predicted by bioinformatics. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were also measured in mothers and newborns. Seven miRNAs were expressed only in obese women (miR-422b, miR-219, miR-575, miR-523, miR-579, miR-618, miR-659), while 13 miRNAs were expressed at a higher level and 12 at a lower level in obese women than in controls. MicroRNAs significantly downregulated the neurotrophin, cancer/ErbB, mTOR, insulin, adipocytokine, actin cytoskeleton and MAPK signaling pathways. In conclusion, we show that the miRNA profile is altered in amnion during obesity and hypothesize that this could affect pathways important for placental growth and function thereby contributing to increase the newborn's risk of future metabolic diseases.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 2 July 2013; doi:10.1038/ijo.2013.121.
