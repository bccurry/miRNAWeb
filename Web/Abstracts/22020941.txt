MicroRNA-31 regulated by the extracellular regulated kinase is involved in vascular smooth muscle cell growth via large tumor suppressor homolog 2. Aberrant growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a major cellular event in the pathogenesis of many proliferative vascular diseases. Recently, microRNA-31 (miR-31) has been found to play a critical role in cancer cell proliferation. However, the biological role of miR-31 in VSMC growth and the mechanisms involved are currently unknown. In the present study, the expression of rat mature miR-31 (rno-miR-31) was determined in cultured VSMCs and in rat carotid arteries. We identified that rno-miR-31 is an abundant miRNA in VSMCs, and its expression was significantly increased in proliferative VSMCs and in vascular walls with neointimal growth. The up-regulation of rno-miR-31 in proliferative VSMCs was inhibited by the inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK). By both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrated that rno-miR-31 had a proproliferative effect on VSMCs. We further identified that LATS2 (large tumor suppressor homolog 2) is a downstream target gene product of rno-miR-31 that is involved in rno-miR-31-mediated effect on VSMC proliferation. The LATS2 as a target gene protein of rno-miR-31 is verified in vivo in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. The results suggest that MAPK/ERK/miR-31/LATS2 may represent a novel signaling pathway in VSMC growth. miR-31 is able to enhance VSMC proliferation via its downstream target gene product, LATS2.
