MicroRNAs and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Esophageal cancer is a common cause of cancer death worldwide. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the most predominant type. Certain microRNAs (miRNAs) function in tumorgenesis involved in important biological and pathologic processes. To reveal miRNAs' signatures of ESCC, we analyzed miRNAs extracted from ESCC cell lines with the microRNA microarray. The significant alterations were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR using miRNAs extracted from cell lines or patients' esophageal biopsy tissues. We found that miR-205 and miR-10a were significantly altered in cellular expression, and might be specific for ESCC with potential roles in the pathogenesis. As a result of function studies in miR-205, alterations in miR-205 expression could modulate the phenotype of epithelial cells towards epithelial-mesenchymal transition characterized by reduced abundance of E-cadherin, that is the ESCC-specific miRNA target and inhibit translationally a representative E-cadherin repressor, ZEB1 and ZEB2. Similarly, miR-10a is reported as a tumor suppressor by controlling cell migration/invasion, as it can target homeobox genes. These results provide insight into the potential mechanisms of ESCC in the pathogenesis. This review also includes a comprehensive overview of the relationship between miRNAs and ESCC.
