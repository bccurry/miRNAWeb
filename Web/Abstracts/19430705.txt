Genetic variation of miRNA sequence in pancreatic cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of 20-22 nucleotides (nts) and constitute a novel class of gene regulators that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The expression of miRNA is deregulated in many types of cancers. Alterations in miRNA expression may be an important contributor to the development of pancreatic carcinoma. We hypothesized that genetic variations in miRNA genes were associated with pancreatic carcinoma and analyzed genomic sequences coding for the precursors of eight miRNA genes in both pancreatic carcinoma tissues and cancer cell lines. Four novel mutations in primary miRNA transcripts were identified. TaqMan miRNA assays showed that miR-21 was significantly overexpressed in 20 pancreatic carcinomas and 6 cancer cell lines compared with paired benign tissues and normal pancreas. Two mutations of miR-21 did not notably alter the activity of the promoter of the miRNA gene. Although most of these mutations seem to have no effect on miRNA processing, an A-G mutation at 29-nt downstream of pre-miR-21 led to a conformational change of the secondary structure close to the stem reaching into the pre-miR-21 and a relative reduction of the mature miR-21 expression in vivo. These results suggested that miRNA might play an important role in pancreatic tumorigenesis, but the molecular mechanism underlying the particular sequence variations in miRNA that can cause aberrant expression remains to be determined.
