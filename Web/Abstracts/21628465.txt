Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) down-regulates microRNA-107, increasing macrophage adhesion via cyclin-dependent kinase 6. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) modulate the expression of multiple microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we report the down-regulation of miR-107 by TLR4 in multiple cell types. The miR-107 sequence occurs in an intron within the sequence encoding the gene for pantothenate kinase 1 (PanK1), which is regulated by the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor  (PPAR-). PanK1 is also decreased in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The effect on both miR-107 and PanK1 is consistent with a decrease in PPAR- expression. We have found that the putative miR-107 target cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) expression is increased by TLR4 as a result of the decrease in miR-107. This effect is required for increased adhesion of macrophages in response to LPS, and CDK6-deficient mice are resistant to the lethal effect of LPS. We have therefore identified a mechanism for LPS signaling which involves a decrease in miR-107 leading to an increase in CDK6.
