Down-regulation of miR-31 expression in gastric cancer tissues and its clinical significance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of target mRNAs. Altered expression of specific miRNAs in several tumor types has been reported. However, the expression levels of miR-31 in gastric cancers are unclear. The objective of the present study was to compare the expression profile of miR-31 between gastric cancer tissues and non-tumor tissues. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect the levels of miR-31 expression. The expression levels of miR-31 in gastric cancer tissues were significantly lower than those in non-tumor tissues. This new information may help to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in gastric carcinogenesis and to indicate that miR-31 may be a novel diagnostic biomarker of gastric cancer.
