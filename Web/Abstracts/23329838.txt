MicroRNA-182 and microRNA-200a control G-protein subunit -13 (GNA13) expression and cell invasion synergistically in prostate cancer cells. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their ligands have been implicated in progression and metastasis of several cancers. GPCRs signal through heterotrimeric G proteins, and among the different types of G proteins, GNA12/13 have been most closely linked to tumor progression. In this study, we explored the role of GNA13 in prostate cancer cell invasion and the mechanism of up-regulation of GNA13 in these cells. An initial screen for GNA13 protein expression showed that GNA13 is highly expressed in the most aggressive cancer cell lines. Knockdown of GNA13 in highly invasive PC3 cells revealed that these cells depend on GNA13 expression for their invasion, migration, and Rho activation. As mRNA levels in these cells did not correlate with protein levels, we assessed the potential involvement of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in post-transcriptional control of GNA13 expression. Expression analysis of miRNAs predicted to bind the 3'-UTR of GNA13 revealed that miR-182 and miR-141/200a showed an inverse correlation to the protein expression in LnCAP and PC3 cells. Ectopic expression of miR-182 and miR-141/200a in PC3 cells significantly reduced protein levels, GNA13-3'-UTR reporter activity and in vitro invasion of these cells. This effect was blocked by restoration of GNA13 expression in these cells. Importantly, inhibition of miR-182 and miR-141/200a in LnCAP cells using specific miRNA inhibitors elevated the expression of GNA13 and enhanced invasion of these cells. These data provide strong evidence that GNA13 is an important mediator of prostate cancer cell invasion, and that miR-182 and miR-200 family members regulate its expression post-transcriptionally.
