MicroRNA-10a targets CHL1 and promotes cell growth, migration and invasion in human cervical cancer cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in cancer initiation, progression and metastasis by regulating their target genes. Here, we found microRNA-10a (miR-10a) is upregulated in human cervical cancer and promotes the colony formation activity, migration and invasion of HeLa and C33A cells. Subsequently, CHL1 is confirmed as a target of miR-10a and is negatively regulated by miR-10a at mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, knockdown of CHL1 expression results in increased colony formation activity, migration and invasion. Finally, overexpression of CHL1 lacked the 3'UTR abolished the effects of miR-10a. Our results may provide a strategy for blocking tumor metastasis.
