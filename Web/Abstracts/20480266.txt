MicroRNA-21 is involved in osteosarcoma cell invasion and migration. MicroRNAs are involved in different cancer-related processes. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21), as an oncomiR, is overexpressed in all kinds of tumors and the role of miR-21 in carcinogenesis is elucidated in many cancers gradually. However, the function of miR-21 in osteosarcoma is still unclear. In our study, we found that miR-21 was significantly overexpressed in osteosarcoma tissues. More importantly, we confirmed that knockdown of miR-21 greatly decreased cell invasion and migration of MG-63. Furthermore, we identified that RECK (reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs), a tumor suppressor gene, was a direct target of miR-21. Finally, the expression of RECK protein negatively correlated with the expression of miR-21 in human osteosarcoma tissues, indicating the potential regulation of RECK by miR-21. Our results suggest that miR-21 expression has a key role in regulating cellular processes in osteosarcoma, likely through regulating RECK and may serve as a therapeutic target.
