MicroRNA miR-885-5p targets CDK2 and MCM5, activates p53 and inhibits proliferation and survival. Several microRNA (miRNA) loci are found within genomic regions frequently deleted in primary neuroblastoma, including miR-885-5p at 3p25.3. In this study, we demonstrate that miR-885-5p is downregulated on loss of 3p25.3 region in neuroblastoma. Experimentally enforced miR-885-5p expression in neuroblastoma cell lines inhibits proliferation triggering cell cycle arrest, senescence and/or apoptosis. miR-885-5p leads to the accumulation of p53 protein and activates the p53 pathway, resulting in upregulation of p53 targets. Enforced miR-885-5p expression consistently leads to downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK2) and mini-chromosome maintenance protein (MCM5). Both genes are targeted by miR-885-5p via predicted binding sites within the 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of CDK2 and MCM5. Transcript profiling after miR-885-5p introduction in neuroblastoma cells reveals alterations in expression of multiple genes, including several p53 target genes and a number of factors involved in p53 pathway activity. Taken together, these data provide evidence that miR-885-5p has a tumor suppressive role in neuroblastoma interfering with cell cycle progression and cell survival.
