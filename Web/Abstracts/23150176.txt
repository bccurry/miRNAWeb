MiR-210 expression in tumor tissue and in vitro effects of its silencing in renal cell carcinoma. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common neoplasm of adult kidney accounting for about 3% of adult malignancies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of naturally occurring, short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. We determined global miRNA expression profiles of RCC and parallel renal parenchyma tissues by using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based TaqMan low-density arrays. Afterward, we validated the difference in miR-210 expression levels on the larger group of RCC patients (35 RCC versus 10 non-tumorous parenchyma samples). Functional in vitro experiments were performed on ACHN and CAKI-2 RCC cell lines transfected with miRNA-210 inhibitor. Cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, scratch wound migration assay, and invasion assay (xCELLigence) were performed. We have identified original ccRCC-specific miRNA signature in clinical samples (73 miRNAs were significantly downregulated and five miRNAs upregulated (P&lt;0.003)). Increased expression levels of miR-210 in RCC tumor tissue were independently validated. We observed decreased viability of ACHN and CAKI-2 cells and accumulation of CAKI-2 in G2 phase of cell cycle after silencing of miR-210 expression. Downregulation of miR-210 also reduced the migratory and invasive potential of ACHN metastatic RCC cells. Moreover, we showed downregulation of HIF1a protein in both cell lines after miR-210 silencing indicating participation of miR-210 in hypoxic processes of RCC not only through regulation of its target mRNAs but also by indirect regulation of HIF1a. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show miR-210 regulatory effects on cell migration, invasive potential, and HIF1a protein in RCC cells.
