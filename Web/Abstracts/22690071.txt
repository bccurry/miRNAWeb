High dose glargine alters the expression profiles of microRNAs in pancreatic cancer cells. To investigate the effect of high dose glargine on the expression profiles of microRNAs in human pancreatic cancer cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction array (RT-PCR) was applied to investigate miRNAs differentially expressed in Sw1990 cells treated with or without 100 IU/L glargine. Stem-loop RT-PCR was used to conrm the results of the array assay in Sw1990 and Panc-1 cells. The effects of miR-95 on cell growth, apoptosis, invasion and migration abilities were respectively examined by CCK8 assay, apoptosis assay, Matrigel invasion and migration assay in Sw1990 and Panc-1 cells. Nude mice xenograft models with Sw1990 cells were built to investigate pancreatic cancer growth in vivo after transfection by the lentivirus pGLV3-GFP- miR-95. Ten miRNAs were significantly up-regulated and 2 miRNAs down-regulated in glargine treated Sw1990 cells when compared with non-treated cells (2.48-fold changes on average, P &lt; 0.01). miR-95, miR-134 and miR-34c-3p are the top three miRNAs regulated by glargine (3.65-fold, 2.67-fold and 2.60-fold changes respectively, P &lt; 0.01) in Sw1990 cells. Stem-loop RT-PCR confirmed that high dose glargine up-regulated the expression of miR-95 and miR-134 in both Sw1990 and Panc-1 cells. The most obvious change is the apparent increase of miR-95. Forced expression of miR-95 significantly increased cell proliferation (Sw1990: 2.510  0.129 vs 2.305  0.187, P &lt; 0.05; Panc-1: 2.439  0.211 vs 2.264  0.117, P &lt; 0.05), invasion (Sw1990: 67.90  12.33 vs 47.30  5.89, P &lt; 0.01; Panc-1: 37.80  8.93 vs 30.20  5.14, P &lt; 0.01), migration (Sw1990: 101  6.00 vs 51.20  8.34, P &lt; 0.01; Panc-1: 91.80  9.22 vs 81.50  7.47, P &lt; 0.01) and inhibited cell apoptosis (Sw1990: 22.05%  1.92% vs 40.32%  1.93%, P &lt; 0.05; Panc-1: 20.17%  0.85% vs 45.60%  1.43%, P &lt; 0.05) when compared with paired negative controls, whereas knockdown of miR-95 obtained the opposite effect. Nude mice xenograft models confirmed that miR-95 promoted the growth of pancreatic cancer in vivo when compared with negative control (tumor volume: 373.82  23.67 mL vs 219.69  17.82 mL, P &lt; 0.05). These observations suggested that modulation of miRNA expression may be an important mechanism underlying the biological effects of glargine.
