MicroRNA-128 downregulates Bax and induces apoptosis in human embryonic kidney cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short ~21-nt non-coding RNA molecules that have been shown to regulate a number of biological processes. Previous reports have shown that overexpression of miR-128 in glioma cells inhibited cell proliferation. Literature also suggests that miR-128 negatively regulates prostate cancer cell invasion. Here, we show that overexpression of hsa-miR-128, a brain-enriched microRNA, induces apoptosis in HEK293T cells as elucidated by apoptosis assay, cell cycle changes, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and multicaspase assay. By in silico analysis, we identified a putative target site within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Bax, a proapoptotic member of the apoptosis pathway. We found that ectopic expression of hsa-miR-128 suppressed a luciferase reporter containing the Bax-3' UTR and reduced the levels of Bax in HEK293T cells. Taken together, our study demonstrates that overexpression of hsa-miR-128 not only induces apoptosis in HEK293T cells but also is an endogenous regulator of Bax protein.
