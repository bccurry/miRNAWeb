Perturbation of 14q32 miRNAs-cMYC gene network in osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma (OS) is the common histological form of primary bone cancer and one of the leading aggressive cancers in children under age fifteen. Although several genetic predisposing conditions have been associated with OS the understanding of its molecular etiology is limited. Here, we show that microRNAs (miRNAs) at the chr.14q32 locus are significantly downregulated in osteosarcoma compared to normal bone tissues. Bioinformatic predictions identified that a subset of 14q32 miRNAs (miR-382, miR-369-3p, miR-544 and miR-134) could potentially target cMYC transcript. The physical interaction between these 14q32 miRNAs and cMYC was validated using reporter assays. Further, restoring expression of these four 14q32 miRNAs decreased cMYC levels and induced apoptosis in Saos2 cells. We also show that exogenous expression of 14q32 miRNAs in Saos2 cells significantly downregulated miR-17-92, a transcriptional target of cMYC. The pro-apoptotic effect of 14q32 miRNAs in Saos2 cells was rescued either by overexpression of cMYC cDNA without the 3'UTR or with miR-17-92 cluster. Further, array comparative genomic hybridization studies showed no DNA copy number changes at 14q32 locus in OS patient samples suggesting that downregulation of 14q32 miRNAs are not due to deletion at this locus. Together, our data support a model where the deregulation of a network involving 14q32 miRNAs, cMYC and miR-17-92 miRNAs could contribute to osteosarcoma pathogenesis.
