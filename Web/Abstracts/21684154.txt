miR-429 modulates the expression of c-myc in human gastric carcinoma cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and may contribute to the development and progression of many cancers. In this study, our goal was to investigate the regulation of miR-429 in gastric cancer and explored the mechanism/s by which it influenced pathogenesis of gastric cancer. We used real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to quantify the expression level of miR-429 in 52 gastric cancer tissues and their paracancerous tissues. Bioinformatics was used to predict downstream target genes of miR-429. SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells were transfected with miR-429 mimics and endogenous c-myc expression was detected by western blots. We performed functional assays using the 3'UTR of the c-myc gene as a miR-429 target in a luciferase reporter assay system. We showed that miR-429 was downregulated in human gastric carcinoma tissue and in SGC-7901 cells. Cell viability, proliferation and attachment were inhibited in miR-429-transfected cells. miR-429 significantly downregulated endogenous c-myc expression in SGC-7901 cells. Action of miR/429 on c-myc 3'UTR was confirmed. The levels of miR-429 in tumour tissue of patients with lymph node metastasis were significantly lower than in those without lymph node metastasis. Our results suggested that miR-429 played a role in the pathogenesis of gastric carcinoma and may function as a recessive cancer gene. c-myc is an important miR-429 target gene.
