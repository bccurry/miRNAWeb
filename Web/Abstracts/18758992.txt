An efficient method to enhance gene silencing by using precursor microRNA designed small hairpin RNAs. Gene silencing can be mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). To investigate the potential application of using a precursor microRNA (pre-miRNA) backbone for gene silencing, we studied the inhibition efficiency of exogenous GFP and endogenous GAPDH by conventional shRNA- and pre-miRNA-designed hairpins, respectively. In this study, the conventional shRNA-, pre-miRNA-30-, and pre-miRNA-155-designed hairpins targeting either GFP or GAPDH were transfected into the HEK293 cells that were mediated by the pSilencer-4.1-neo vector, which carries a modified RNA polymerase II-type CMV promoter. Comparisons with conventional GFP shRNA showed that GFP levels were reduced markedly by pre-miRNA-30- and pre-miRNA-155-designed GFP shRNAs by fluorescence microscopy. The consistent results from semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed that pre-miRNA-30- and pre-miRNA-155-designed GFP shRNAs could suppress GFP expression significantly. As for endogenous GAPDH, the results from semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that pre-miRNA-30- and pre-miRNA-155-designed GAPDH shRNAs could suppress GAPDH expression even more efficiently than conventional GAPDH shRNA. Together, this study confirmed the efficiency of gene silencing mediated by pre-miRNA-30- and pre-miRNA-155-designed shRNAs, demonstrating that pre-miRNA-designed hairpins are a good strategy for gene silencing.
