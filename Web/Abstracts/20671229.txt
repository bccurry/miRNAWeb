Ets-1 and Ets-2 regulate the expression of microRNA-126 in endothelial cells. MicroRNA plays important roles in vascular biology, but the regulation of endothelial-specific microRNA is not well characterized. MicroRNA-126 (miR-126) is highly expressed in endothelial cells, and it regulates angiogenesis and vascular inflammation. Here we show that the transcription factors Ets-1 and Ets-2 regulate miR-126 expression. A genomic region between -71 and -100 bp upstream of the miR-126 transcriptional start site is critical for transactivation of the gene containing miR-126. This genomic region contains a potential Ets binding site. Mutations within the Ets binding site block transactivation, and Ets-1 and Ets-2 interact with this critical genomic region. Knockdown of endogenous Ets-1 and Ets-2 decreases miR-126 expression. Finally, knockdown of miR-126 alters regulation of an Ets-1 target gene. Taken together, these data show that the transcription factors Ets-1 and Ets-2 play a key role in controlling the expression of miR-126 and suggest that miR-126 may mediate some of their vascular effects.
