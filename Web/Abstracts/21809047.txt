Camptothecin induces p53-dependent and -independent apoptogenic signaling in melanoma cells. Various DNA-targeting agents may initiate p53-dependent as well as p53-independent response and subsequent apoptosis via alternative cellular systems which include for instance p73, caspase-2 or Bcl-2 family proteins. The scope of involvement of individual molecules in this process and the mechanisms governing their potential interplay are still not entirely understood, in particular in highly aggressive cancers such as in malignant melanoma. In this work we investigated the role and involvement of both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms in selected melanoma cell lines with differing status of p53 using a model DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT). Here we report that CPT induced in Bowes melanoma cells apoptosis which is essentially p53 and mitochondria-dependent but with some involvement of caspase-2 and p73. Conversely, in mutant p53 melanoma cells overall levels of CPT-induced apoptosis are significantly lower, with p73 and caspase-2 signaling playing important roles. In addition, in these cells the expression of micro RNAs family 34 (miR-34) were low compared to wild-type p53 cells. The ectopic expression of wild type p53 than restored apoptotic response of cells to CPT despite the fact that the expression of miR-34 and miR-155 were not influenced. These results suggest that CPT induces multivariate cellular stress responses including activation of DNA-damage response-p53 pathway as well as p53-independent signaling and their mutual crosstalk play the decisive role in the efficient triggering of apoptosis in melanoma cells.
