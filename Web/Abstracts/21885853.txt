MicroRNA-758 regulates cholesterol efflux through posttranscriptional repression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1. The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a major regulator of macrophage cholesterol efflux and protects cells from excess intracellular cholesterol accumulation; however, the mechanism involved in posttranscriptional regulation of ABCA1 is poorly understood. We previously showed that microRNA-33 (miR-33) is 1 regulator. Here, we investigated the potential contribution of other microRNAs (miRNAs) to posttranscriptional regulation of ABCA1 and macrophage cholesterol efflux. We performed a bioinformatic analysis for identifying miRNA target prediction sites in ABCA1 gene and an unbiased genome-wide screen to identify miRNAs modulated by cholesterol excess in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed that miR-758 is repressed in cholesterol-loaded macrophages. Under physiological conditions, high dietary fat excess in mice repressed miR-758 both in peritoneal macrophages and, to a lesser extent, in the liver. In mouse and human cells in vitro, miR-758 repressed the expression of ABCA1, and conversely, the inhibition of this miRNA by using anti-miR-758 increased ABCA1 expression. In mouse cells, miR-758 reduced cellular cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), and anti-miR-758 increased it. miR-758 directly targets the 3'-untranslated region of Abca1 as assessed by 3'-untranslated region luciferase reporter assays. Interestingly, miR-758 is highly expressed in the brain, where it also targets several genes involved in neurological functions, including Slc38a1, Ntm, Epha7, and Mytl1. We identified miR-758 as a novel miRNA that posttranscriptionally controls ABCA1 levels in different cells and regulates macrophage cellular cholesterol efflux to apoA1, opening new avenues to increase apoA1 and raise high-density lipoprotein levels.
