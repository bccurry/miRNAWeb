miRNA-96 suppresses KRAS and functions as a tumor suppressor gene in pancreatic cancer. Therapeutic applications of microRNA (miRNA) in KRAS-driven pancreatic cancers might be valuable, but few studies have explored this area. Here, we report that miR-96 directly targets the KRAS oncogene and functions as a tumor-suppressing miRNA in pancreatic cancer cells. Ectopic expression of miR-96 through a synthetic miRNA precursor inhibited KRAS, dampened Akt signaling, and triggered apoptosis in cells. In human clinical specimens, miR-96 was downregulated or deleted where an association with KRAS elevations was observed. In vitro and in vivo assays established that miR-96 decreased cancer cell invasion and migration and slowed tumor growth in a manner associated with KRAS downregulation. Our findings identify miR-96 as a potent regulator of KRAS, which may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of pancreatic cancer and other KRAS-driven cancers.
