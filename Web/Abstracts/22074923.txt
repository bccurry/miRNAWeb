MicroRNA 34c gene down-regulation via DNA methylation promotes self-renewal and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast tumor-initiating cells. Tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs), a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem cell-like properties, are related to tumor relapse and metastasis. Our previous studies identified a distinct profile of microRNA (miRNA) expression in breast T-ICs (BT-ICs), and the dysregulated miRNAs contribute to the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of these cells. However, the underlying mechanisms for miRNA dysregulation in BT-ICs remain obscure. In the present study, we demonstrated that the expression and function of miR-34c were reduced in the BT-ICs of MCF-7 and SK-3rd cells, a breast cancer cell line enriched for BT-ICs. Ectopic expression of miR-34c reduced the self-renewal of BT-ICs, inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and suppressed migration of the tumor cells via silencing target gene Notch4. Furthermore, we identified a single hypermethylated CpG site in the promoter region of miR-34c gene that contributed to transcriptional repression of miR-34c in BT-ICs by reducing DNA binding activities of Sp1. Therefore, miR-34c reduction in BT-ICs induced by a single hypermethylated CpG site in the promoter region promotes self-renewal and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of BT-ICs.
