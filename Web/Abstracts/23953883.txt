Caprin-1 is a novel microRNA-223 target for regulating the proliferation and invasion of human breast cancer cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-22 nucleotides regulatory small non-coding RNAs that inhibit gene expression by binding to complementary sequences especially the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of mRNA. One miRNA can target many messenger RNAs, leading to a complex metabolic network. Previous studies have shown that miRNA-223 regulates migration and invasion of tumor cells and targets cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein-1 (Caprin-1). In the present study, we detected the expression of miRNA-223 and Caprin-1 in MCF-7, T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell lines, and MCF-10A normal breast cell line, and analyzed the role of miRNA-223 in Caprin-1-induced proliferation and invasion of human breast cancer cells. We found that miRNA-223 expression levels are significantly lower in MCF-7, T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells than in MCF-10A normal breast cells, while Caprin-1 expression is higher in cancer cells than in normal breast cells. The most malignant cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 has the lowest expression of miR-223, but the highest expression of Caprin-1. Further, we found that miR-223 targets the 3'UTR of Caprin-1 miRNA and down-regulates the expression of Caprin-1. We also found that over-expression of Caprin-1 can promote the proliferation and the invasion of breast cancer cells, but miRNA-223 can inhibit the proliferation and the invasion. miRNA-223-induced inhibition can be reversed by ectopic over-expression of Caprin-1. These findings suggest that miR-223 may suppress the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells by directly targeting Caprin-1. Our study also indicates that expression levels of miR-223 and Caprin-1 can be used to predict the state of cancer in breast cancer patient.
