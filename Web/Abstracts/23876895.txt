MiRNA-365 and miRNA-520c-3p respond to risperidone treatment in first-episode schizophrenia after a 1 year remission. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control gene expression by destabilizing target transcripts and inhibiting their translation. Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been described in many human diseases, including schizophrenia. However, the effects on miRNA expression in response to antipsychotic treatment in peripheral circulation have not been thoroughly examined. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), We quantified the expression of seven candidate miRNAs in plasma samples of 40 first-episode schizophrenics before and after antipsychotic treatment. The patients were all treated with risperidone and achieved remission in 1 year. Compared with the baseline, the expression levels of miR-365 and miR-520c-3p were significantly down-regulated after 1 year of risperidone treatment (P &lt; 0.001). There were no significant correlations between the clinical symptoms and the expression levels of these two miRNAs (P &gt; 0.05). This study analyzed possible circulating miRNAs in response to antipsychotic monotherapy for schizophrenia, the further mechanism need to be confirmed.
