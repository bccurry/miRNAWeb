Pre-mir-27a rs895819 polymorphism and cancer risk: a meta-analysis. Aberrant expression of miRNAs plays critical roles in cancer development. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in miRNA precursors may affect miRNA expression levels. An important SNP in the pre-mir-27a with a A to G change (rs895819) was identified. Several original studies have explored the role of this SNP in cancer risk, but the results of these studies remain conflicting rather than conclusive. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of the published studies to derive a more precise estimation of the association between pre-mir-27a rs895819 polymorphism and cancer risk. In this meta-analysis, a total of 6 case-control studies (including 3,255 cases and 4,181 controls) were analyzed. The results of the overall meta-analysis did not suggest any associations between pre-mir-27a rs895819 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility. However, an decreased risk was observed in the subgroup of breast cancer patients (G vs A: OR = 0.90, 95 % CI = 0.83 ~ 0.97; P heterogeneity = 0.75) or in the subgroup of Caucasian race (G vs A: OR = 0.90, 95 % CI = 0.83 ~ 0.97, P heterogeneity = 0.78, I (2) = 0; AG vs AA: OR = 0.84, 95 % CI = 0.75 ~ 0.94, P heterogeneity = 0.35, I (2) = 3.7 %; GG+AG vs AA: OR = 0.85, 95 % CI = 0.76 ~ 0.94, P heterogeneity = 0.48, I (2) = 0). The findings suggest that pre-mir-27a rs895819 polymorphism may have some relation to breast cancer susceptibility or cancer development in Caucasian.
