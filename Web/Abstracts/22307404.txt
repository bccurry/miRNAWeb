miR-125b targets ARID3B in breast cancer cells. Mounting evidence suggests involvement of deregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression during the complex events of tumorigenesis. Among such deregulated miRNAs in cancer, miR-125b expression is reported to be consistently low in breast cancers. In this study, we screened a panel of breast cancer cell lines (BCCLs) for miR-125b expression and detected decreased expression in 14 of 19 BCCLs. Due to the heterogeneity of breast cancers, MCF7 cells were chosen as a model system for ERBB2 independent breast cancers to restore miR-125b expression (MCF7-125b) to investigate the phenotypical and related functional changes. Earlier, miR-125b was shown to regulate cell motility by targeting ERBB2 in ERBB2 overexpressing breast cancer cells. Here we showed decreased motility and migration in miR-125b expressing MCF7 cells, independent of ERBB2. MCF7-125b cells demonstrated profoundly decreased cytoplasmic protrusions detected by phalloidin staining of filamentous actin along with decreased motility and migration behaviors detected by in vitro wound closure and transwell migration assays compared to empty vector transfected cells (MCF7-EV). Among possible numerous targets of miR-125b, we showed ARID3B (AT-rich interactive domain 3B) to be a novel target with roles in cell motility in breast cancer cells. When ARID3B was transiently silenced, the decreased cell migration was also observed. In light of these findings, miR-125b continues to emerge as an interesting regulator of cancer related phenotypes.
