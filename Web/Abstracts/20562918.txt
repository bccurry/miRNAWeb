Tumor-suppressive microRNA-22 inhibits the transcription of E-box-containing c-Myc target genes by silencing c-Myc binding protein. Oncogenic c-Myc has been described to modulate the expression of a subset of microRNAs (miRNAs), which include miR-22; however, the mechanism through which a miRNA controls c-Myc activity remains unclear. Here we report a novel anti-c-Myc function mediated by miR-22. Ectopically expressed miR-22 inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of human cancer cell lines. Microarray screening and western analyses revealed that miR-22 repressed the c-Myc-binding protein MYCBP, a positive regulator of c-Myc. Consistent with this, reporter assays showed that miR-22-mediated MYCBP gene suppression largely depends on the conserved miR-22 target site within the MYCBP 3'-untranslational region (3'UTR), implying that MYCBP mRNA is a direct miR-22 target. Depletion of MYCBP using small interfering RNA (siRNA) recapitulated the miR-22-induced anti-growth effect on tumor cells, whereas ectopically expressed MYCBP rescued cells from the growth suppression mediated by miR-22. Moreover, repression of MYCBP by miR-22 downregulated a panel of E-box-containing c-Myc target genes. Our results suggest that miR-22 acts as a tumor suppressor through direct repression of MYCBP expression and subsequent reduction of oncogenic c-Myc activities. As c-Myc inhibits the expression of miR-22, we propose a novel positive feedback loop formed by oncogenic c-Myc to accelerate cell proliferation by suppressing miR-22, a potent inhibitor of MYCBP.
