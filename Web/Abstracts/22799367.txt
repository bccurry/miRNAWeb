Serum miR-21 expression in human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. To investigate the relationship between serum miRNA-21 (miR-21) expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) and their clinicopathologic features, a 1:1 matched case-control study including 21 patients with ESCC and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy controls was carried out. Serum specimens were taken from all subjects. Total RNA was extracted and the stem-loop real time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure serum miR-21 in both groups. Clinical parameters were assessed to determine associations with serum miR-21 concentrations. Serum miR-21 expression in ESCC samples was significantly higher than in paired cancer-free samples (P &lt;0.05). Metastasis was associated with mir-21 expression in serum (P &lt;0.05), ESCC patients with metastasis having 8.4-fold higher serum miR-21 concentrations than healthy controls. There were no statistically significant associations between miR-21 expression and clinicopathologic parameters, such as gender (P &gt;0.05), age (P &gt;0.05), tumor location (P &gt;0.05), cell differentiation (P &gt;0.05), TNM staging (P &gt;0.05), whether chemo/radiotherapy had been administered (P &gt;0.05), or whether surgery had been performed (P &gt;0.05). These findings suggest that the detection of microRNA-21 in serum might serve as a new tumor biomarker in diagnosis and assessment of prognosis of ESCCs.
