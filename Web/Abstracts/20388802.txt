miR-212 increases tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer by targeting the antiapoptotic protein PED. PED/PEA-15 (PED) is a death effector domain family member of 15 kDa with a broad antiapoptotic function found overexpressed in a number of different human tumors, including lung cancer. To date, the mechanisms that regulate PED expression are unknown. Therefore, we address this point by the identification of microRNAs that in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) modulate PED levels. In this work, we identify miR-212 as a negative regulator of PED expression. We also show that ectopic expression of this miR increases tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced cell death in NSCLC cells. In contrast, inhibition of endogenous miR-212 by use of antago-miR results in increase of PED protein expression and resistance to TRAIL treatment. Besides, in NSCLC, we show both in vitro and in vivo that PED and miR-212 expressions are inversely correlated, that is, PED is upregulated and miR-212 is rarely expressed. In conclusion, these findings suggest that miR-212 should be considered as a tumor suppressor because it negatively regulates the antiapoptotic protein PED and regulates TRAIL sensitivity.
