Post-transcriptional control of candidate risk genes for type 1 diabetes by rare genetic variants. The genetic variation causal for predisposition to type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains unidentified for the majority of known T1D risk loci. MicroRNAs function as post-transcriptional gene regulators by targeting microRNA-binding sites in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNA. Genetic variation within the 3'-UTR of T1D-associated genes may contribute to T1D development by altering microRNA-mediated gene regulation. In silico analysis of variable sites predicted altered microRNA binding in established T1D loci. Functional implications were assessed for variable sites in the 3'-UTR of T1D candidate risk genes CTLA4 and IL10, both involved in immune regulation. We confirmed that in these genes 3'-UTR variation either disrupted or introduced a microRNA-binding site, affecting the repressive capacity of miR-302a* and miR-523, respectively. Our study points to the potential of 3'-UTR variation to affect T1D pathogenesis by altering post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs.
