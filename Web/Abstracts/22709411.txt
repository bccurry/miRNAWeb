MiR-21 Modulates hTERT Through a STAT3-Dependent Manner on Glioblastoma Cell Growth. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As an important oncogenic miRNA, miR-21 has been reported to play crucial roles in glioblastoma (GBM) carcinogenesis. However, the precise biological function and molecular mechanism of miR-21 in GBM remain elusive. This study is designed to explore the mechanism of miR-21 involved in the control of GBM cell growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: MTT assay, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis analysis showed that reduction of miR-21 inhibited cell growth in U87 and LN229 GBM cells. Further, reduction of miR-21 decreased the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and repressed STAT3 expression and STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 inhibition led to a remarkable depletion of hTERT at both mRNA and protein levels by binding to the hTERT gene promoter by performing luciferase reporter assay and chromatin Immunoprecipitation PCR. Finally, knockdown of miR-21 considerably inhibited tumor growth and diminished the expression of STAT3 and hTERT in xenograft model. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that miR-21 regulates hTERT expression mediated by STAT3, therefore controlling GBM cell growth.
