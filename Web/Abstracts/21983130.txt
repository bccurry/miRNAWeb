Expression of the tumor suppressor miR-206 is associated with cellular proliferative inhibition and impairs invasion in ER-positive endometrioid adenocarcinoma. This study investigated the role of miR-206 in estrogen receptor- (ER)-positive endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EEC). We profiled miR-206 expression in 30 EEC clinical samples using qRT-PCR, and explored its relationship with ER and clinical parameters. A luciferase reporter assay assessed the ER targeting potential of miR-206. Functional analyses of miR-206 were performed in EEC cell lines. MiRNA-206 expression decreased in ER-positive EECs, and its expression was negatively correlated with ER. MiRNA-206 overexpression inhibited ER-dependent proliferation, impaired invasiveness and induced cell cycle arrest of ER-positive EEC cell lines. Therefore, aberrantly expressed miRNA-206 may be associated with the development of ER-positive EEC.
