MicroRNA-181b regulates articular chondrocytes differentiation and cartilage integrity. MicroRNAs are endogenous gene regulators that have been implicated in various developmental and pathological processes. However, the precise identities and functions of the miRNAs involved in cartilage development are not yet well understood. Here, we report that miR-181b regulates chondrocyte differentiation and maintains cartilage integrity, and is thus a potent therapeutic target. MiR-181b was significantly down-regulated during chondrogenic differentiation of TGF-3-stimulated limb mesenchymal cells, but it was significantly up-regulated in osteoarthritic chondrocytes isolated from the cartilage of osteoarthritis patients. The use of a mimic or an inhibitor to alter miR-181b levels in chondroblasts and articular chondrocytes showed that attenuation of miR-181b reduced MMP-13 expression while inducing type II collagen expression. Furthermore, over-expression of anti-miR-181b significantly reduced the cartilage destruction caused by DMM surgery in mice. In sum, our data suggest that miR-181b is a negative regulator of cartilage development, and that inhibition of miR-181b could be an effective therapeutic strategy for cartilage-related disease.
