[MiRNAs in follicular thyroid tumors]. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA ensuring post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Their expression is tissue-specific and some miRNAs have diagnostic and/or prognostic interest for tumor classes. MiRNAs are involved in tumoral process in quantitative (amplification, deletion of chromosomal regions) or qualitative terms (mutation in the miRNA or in the corresponding site of interaction in the mRNA). Overexpression of three miRNAs (miR-146b, miR-221 and miR-222) correlates with the development of papillary thyroid tumors. Polymorphisms in the c-kit gene or in that encoding miR-146a are susceptibility factors for the development of papillary thyroid tumors.
