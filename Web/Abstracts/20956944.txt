MicroRNA miR-93 promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis by targeting integrin-8. It has been reported that the miR-106b25 cluster, a paralog of the miR-1792 cluster, possesses oncogenic activities. However, the precise role of each microRNA (miRNA) in the miR-106b25 cluster is not yet known. In this study, we examined the function of miR-93, one of the microRNAs within the miR-106b25 cluster, in angiogenesis and tumor formation. We found that miR-93 enhanced cell survival, promoted sphere formation and augmented tumor growth. Most strikingly, when miR-93-overexpressing U87 cells were co-cultured with endothelial cells, they supported endothelial cell spreading, growth, migration and tube formation. In vivo studies revealed that miR-93-expressing cells induced blood vessel formation, allowing blood vessels to extend to tumor tissues in high densities. Angiogenesis promoted by miR-93 in return facilitated cell survival, resulting in enhanced tumor growth. We further showed that integrin-8 is a target of miR-93. Higher levels of integrin-8 are associated with cell death in tumor mass and in human glioblastoma. Silencing of integrin-8 expression using small interfering RNA promoted cell proliferation, whereas ectopic expression of integrin-8 decreased cell growth. These findings showed that miR-93 promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis by suppressing, at least in part, integrin-8 expression. Our results suggest that inhibition of miR-93 function may be a feasible approach to suppress angiogenesis and tumor growth.
