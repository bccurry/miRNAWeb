MiR-224 targets the 3'UTR of type 1 5'-iodothyronine deiodinase possibly contributing to tissue hypothyroidism in renal cancer. Type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO1) catalyses the conversion of prohormone thyroxine to the active thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3), important regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. DIO1 expression is reduced in the most common type of kidney neoplasia, clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC). MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at posttranscriptional levels. The aim of this study was to analyze the potential regulation of DIO1 expression by microRNAs in ccRCC. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that 3'UTR of the human DIO1 gene transcript contains miR-224 and miR-383 target sites, which are conserved across mammalian species. Semi-quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression of miR-224 and miR-383 in 32 samples of ccRCC tumors (T) and in 32 matched control (C) samples. We observed statistically significant (p=0.0002) more than four fold increase in miR-224 expression and nearly two fold increase in miR-383 expression in samples T compared to samples C. Tumor specific changes in expression of miR-224 negatively correlated with changes in DIO1 expression and intracellular T3 concentration. Transfection of HeLa cell line with miR-224 and miR-383 suppressed the activity of a luciferase reporter containing the 3'UTR of DIO1. This was abolished when constructs mutated at the miR-224 and miR-383 target sites were used instead, indicating that miR-224 and miR-383 directly bind to DIO1 3'UTR. Finally, induced expression of miR-224 in Caki-2 cells resulted in significant (p&lt;0.01) reduction of DIO1 mRNA. This study provides a novel miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism of DIO1 expression in ccRCC.
