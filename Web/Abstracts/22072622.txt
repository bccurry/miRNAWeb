MicroRNA-21 induces stemness by downregulating transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGFR2) in colon cancer cells. Although microRNA-21 (miR-21) is emerging as an oncogene and has been shown to target several tumor suppressor genes, including programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), its precise mechanism of action on cancer stem cells (CSCs) is unclear. Herein, we report that FOLFOX-resistant HCT-116 and HT-29 cells that are enriched in CSCs show a 3- to 7-fold upregulation of pre- and mature miR-21 and downregulation of PDCD4. Likewise, overexpression of miR-21 in HCT-116 cells, achieved through stable transfection, led to the downregulation of PDCD4 and transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGFR2). In contrast, the levels of -catenin, TCF/LEF activity and the expression of c-Myc, Cyclin-D, which are increased in CSCs, are also augmented in miR-21 overexpressing colon cancer cells, accompanied by an increased sphere forming ability in vitro and tumor formation in SCID mice. Downregulation of TGFR2 could be attributed to decreased expression of the receptor as evidenced by reduction in the activity of the luciferase gene construct comprising TGFR2-3' untranslated region (UTR) sequence that binds to miR-21. Moreover, we observed that downregulation of miR-21 enhances luciferase-TGFR2-3' UTR activity suggesting TGFR2 as being one of the direct targets of miR-21. Further support is provided by the observation that transfection of TGFR2 in HCT-116 cells attenuates TCF/LEF luciferase activity, accompanied by decreased expression of -catenin, c-Myc and Cyclin-D1. Our current data suggest that miR-21 plays an important role in regulating stemness by modulating TGFR2 signaling in colon cancer cells.
