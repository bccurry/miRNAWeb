Synthesis and biological activity of phosphonoacetate- and thiophosphonoacetate-modified 2'-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides. Chimeric 2'-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides (2'-OMe ORNs) containing internucleotide linkages which were modified with phosphonoacetate (PACE) or thiophosphonoacetate (thioPACE) were prepared by solid-phase synthesis. The modified 2'-OMe ORNs contained a central phosphate or phosphorothioate sequence with up to 4 PACE or thioPACE modifications, respectively, at either end of the ORN in a &quot;gapmer&quot; motif. Both PACE and thioPACE 2'-OMe ORNs formed stable duplexes with complementary RNA. The majority of these duplexes had higher thermal melting temperatures than an unmodified RNA:RNA duplex. The modified 2'-OMe ORNs were effective passenger strands with complementary, unmodified siRNAs, for inducing siRNA activity in a dual luciferase assay in the presence of a lipid transfecting agent. As single strands, thioPACE 2'-OMe ORNs were efficiently taken up by HeLa cells in the absence of a lipid transfecting agent. Furthermore, thioPACE modifications greatly improved the potency of a 2'-OMe phosphorothioate ORN as an inhibitor of microRNA-122 in Huh7 cells, without lipid transfection.
