Context-dependent bidirectional regulation of the MutS homolog 2 by transforming growth factor  contributes to chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. The TGF-, a tumor suppressive cytokine in normal cells, is abused in cancer to promote the malignancy. In this study, we reported that TGF- downregulated the mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), a central component of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, in HER2-transformed MCF10A mammary epithelial cells and in breast cancer (BC) cells. This was mediated by a TGF--induced micro RNA (miRNA), miR-21, which targeted the 3' untranslated region of MSH2 mRNA and downregulated its expression. A negative correlation between the expression of TGF-1 and MSH2 was also detected in primary breast tumors. In contrast, TGF- upregulated MSH2 in nontransformed cells through Smad-mediated, p53-dependent promoter activation, which was absent in BC cells with impaired p53 function. Although this upregulating mechanism also existed in MCF10A/HER2 and p53-proficient BC cells, both basal and TGF--induced MSH2 promoter activities were significantly lower than those in MCF10A. Moreover, the basal and TGF--induced miR-21 levels were markedly higher in transformed cells, suggesting that the preset levels of miR-21 and MSH2 promoter activity, which is affected by the p53 status, determine the outputs of the bidirectional regulation of MSH2 by TGF- in a certain cellular context. We further found that by downregulating MSH2, TGF- contributed to resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapy agents in cancer cells. Our results indicated a regulatory antagonism between promoter activation and miRNA-mediated posttranscriptional inhibition underlying a dual effect of TGF- on the DNA repair machinery, which may influence the genomic stability in a context-dependent manner and contribute to chemoresistance in cancer.
