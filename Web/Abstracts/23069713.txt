The promotion of cardiogenic differentiation of hMSCs by targeting epidermal growth factor receptor using microRNA-133a. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are an attractive candidate for cell therapy in heart disease. Low survival and incomplete electromechanical integration between resident cardiomyocytes and transplanted hMSCs remain unsolved. In order for an infarcted heart to tolerate transplantation, differentiation capacity in stem cells must be reinforced. In this study, we found that compound 56, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, promotes cardiogenic differentiation of hMSCs and the transplantation of hMSCs treated with compound 56 resulted in enhancement of heart functions. Furthermore, hMSCs transfected with microRNA-133a (miR-133a), which targets EGFR, were observed to express cardiac-specific markers. We also discovered that luciferase activity is exclusively decreased by targeting EGFR in hMSCs transfected with miR-133a mimic. These results suggest that EGFR plays a key role in the regulation of cardiogenic differentiation in hMSCs.
