miR-320 Regulates Glucose-Induced Gene Expression in Diabetes. miRNAs play an important role in several biological processes. Here, we investigated miR-320 in glucose-induced augmented production of vasoactive factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. High glucose exposure decreased the expression of microRNA 320 (miR-320) but increased the expression of endothelin 1 (ET-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and fibronectin (FN) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Transfection of miR-320 mimics restored ET-1, VEGF and FN mRNA, and protein expression in HUVECs treated with high glucose. Furthermore, miR-320 mimic transfection reduced glucose-induced augmented production of ERK1/2. Data from this study indicates that miR-320 negatively regulates expression of ET-1, VEGF, and FN through ERK 1/2. Identification of such novel glucose-induced mechanism regulating gene expression may offer a new strategy for the treatment of diabetic complications.
