Involvement of microRNA-21 in mediating chemo-resistance to docetaxel in androgen-independent prostate cancer PC3 cells. To investigate whether microRNA-21 was involved in mediating the chemoresistance of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel. A microarray technique was used to determine the miRNA profile in docetaxel-resistant PC3 cells. Real-time PCR was used to confirm the array results. miR-21 mimics and inhibitors were synthesized and introduced to cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Cell proliferation was examined with the CCK-8 assay. Luciferase reporter containing PDCD 3'UTR was constructed and the activity was detected by a dual luciferase assay. PDCD4 protein expression was evaluated using Western blot. A docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer PC3 cell line (PC3R) was established . Using microarrays, miR-21 was found to be up-regulated in PC3R cells. Ectopic expression of miR-21 increased the resistance to docetaxel in PC3 wild type cells. In contrast, silencing of miR-21 in PC3R cells sensitized the cells to docetaxel. The IC(50) values for miR-21-silencing cells and control cells were 28.31 and 35.89 nmol/L, respectively. PDCD4, a direct target gene of miR-21, could mediate chemoresistance to docetaxel in PC3 cells. Our findings suggest that miR-21 contributed to the resistance of PC3 cells to docetaxel, and that targeting miR-21 may offer a promising therapeutic approach in sensitizing prostate cancer to docetaxel treatment.
