MicroRNA-199a-5p is associated with hypoxia inducible factor-1 expression in the lung from COPD patients. Abstract BACKGROUND:MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs which silence target gene expression post-transcriptionally, and their impact on gene expression has been reported in various diseases. It has been reported that the expression of the hypoxia inducible factor -1 alpha (HIF-1) is reduced and that of p53 is increased in the lungs from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. However, the role of miRNAs associated with these genes in the lungs from COPD patients is unknown. METHODS:Lung tissue samples from 55 patients were included in this study. Total RNA, miRNA and protein were extracted from lung tissues and used for RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell culture experiments were performed using cultured human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVEC). RESULTS:miR-34a and miR-199a-5p expression was increased and the phosphorylation of AKT was decreased in COPD lungs. The miR-199a-5p expression was correlated with HIF-1 protein expression in COPD patient's lungs. Transfection of HPMVEC with the miR-199a-5p precursor gene decreased HIF-1 protein expression, and transfection with the miR-34a precursor gene increased miR-199a-5p expression. CONCLUSIONS:These data suggest that miR-34a and miR-199a-5p contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD and these miRNAs may also affect the HIF-1 dependent lung structure maintenance program.
