MicroRNA let-7a inhibits the proliferation and invasion of nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line 95D by regulating K-Ras and HMGA2 gene expression. MicroRNAs are closely linked to tumor metastasis and let-7a may play a role in inhibiting the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of lung cancer. In vitro, we aim to observe the impact of let-7a on the proliferation and invasion of the nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line 95D by constructing a lentiviral vector that expresses let-7a. Cell proliferation assays and Transwell experiments were used to compare the proliferation and invasion of the 95D cell group with let-7a overexpressed or inhibited. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting analysis were used to compare the expression of K-RAS and HMGA2 at mRNA and the protein level in the above groups. The results showed the cells in the let-7a overexpressed group were significantly less proliferative and invasive than those in the let-7a inhibited group (p &lt; 0.05). K-RAS and HMGA2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in the let-7a overexpressed group than those in the let-7a inhibited group (p &lt; 0.05). However, the protein levels of K-RAS and HMGA2 were significantly lower in the let-7a overexpressed group than those in the let-7a inhibited group (p &lt; 0.05). We suppose that let-7a inhibits the proliferation and invasion of the cell line 95D by regulating the translation of K-RAS and HMGA2 mRNA, not the transcription of the mRNA itself.
