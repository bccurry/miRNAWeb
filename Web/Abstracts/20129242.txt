All you need is a Mir-acle: the role of nontranslated RNAs in the suppression of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. miR-15a and miR-16-1 were the first microRNAs linked to cancer because their genes are commonly deleted in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In this issue of Cancer Cell, Klein and coworkers show that deleting a region with these genes in mouse provides a faithful model for human CLL.
