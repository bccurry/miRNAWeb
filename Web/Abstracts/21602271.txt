Identification of novel microRNA signatures linked to human lupus disease activity and pathogenesis: miR-21 regulates aberrant T cell responses through regulation of PDCD4 expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the expression of genes involved in immune activation. A study was undertaken to characterise the miRNA signature and identify novel genes involved in the regulation of immune responses in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The expression of 365 miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with SLE and healthy controls was analysed using TaqMan Low Density Arrays. The results were validated by quantitative real-time PCR and potential target genes were identified using prediction analysis software. The effect of miR-21 on T cell function was assessed by transfection with antago-miR-21 or pre-miR-21. A 27-miRNA signature was identified in patients with SLE; 19 miRNAs correlated with disease activity. Eight miRNAs were deregulated specifically in T cells and four miRNAs in B cells. miR-21 was upregulated and strongly correlated with SLE disease activity (r(2)=0.92). Compared with controls, CD4 T lymphocytes from patients with SLE had higher basal and activation-induced miR-21 expression. Silencing of miR-21 reversed the activated phenotype of T cells from patients with SLE--namely, enhanced proliferation, interleukin 10 production, CD40L expression and their capacity to drive B cell maturation into Ig-secreting CD19+CD38(hi)IgD-(plasma cells. Overexpression of mMiR-21 in normal T cells led to acquisition of an activated phenotype. Investigation of putative gene- targets showed that PDCD4 (a selective protein translation inhibitor) was suppressed by miR-21 and its expression was decreased in active SLE. miRNAs represent potential biomarkers in SLE as their expression reflects underlying pathogenic processes and correlates with disease activity. Upregulated miR-21 affects PDCD4 expression and regulates aberrant T cell responses in human SLE.
