Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus taps into a host microRNA regulatory network. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), the causative agent of several neoplasms, has recently been shown to encode 12 microRNAs. mir-155 is a host-encoded microRNA associated with lymphomagenesis. Two new papers provide strong evidence that a KSHV-encoded microRNA and mir-155 share a common set of mRNA targets and binding sites, implying a possible link between viral- and non-viral-mediated tumorigenesis.
