Posttranscriptional regulation of interleukin-10 expression by hsa-miR-106a. IL-10 is a key regulator of the immune system that critically determines health and disease. Its expression is finely tuned both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Although the importance of posttranscriptional regulation of IL-10 has been previously shown, understanding the underlying mechanisms is still in its infancy. In this study, using a combination of bioinformatics and molecular approaches, we report that microRNA (hsa-miR-106a) regulates IL-10 expression. The hsa-miR-106a binding site in the 3' UTR of IL10 has been identified by site-directed mutagenesis studies. Also, the involvement of transcription factors, Sp1 and Egr1, in the regulation of hsa-miR-106a expression and concomitant decrease in the IL-10 expression, has also been demonstrated. In summary, our results showed that IL-10 expression may be regulated by miR-106a, which is in turn transcriptionally regulated by Egr1 and Sp1.
