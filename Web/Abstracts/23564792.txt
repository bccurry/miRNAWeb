miRNA expression profiles of oral squamous cell carcinomas. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) development involves complex machinery of genomic and epigenetic regulations including microRNA (miRNA) expression changes. We aimed to analyze the expression patterns of a set of miRNAs in human TNM stage I and II OSCC samples in an autologous normal mucosa-controlled experimental design. Forty samples of OSCC and 40 matched normal tissues were evaluated for miR-21, miR-155, miR-191, miR-146a, miR-221 and miR-222 expression in a LightCycler 480(PCR) system. Our results showed significant overexpression of miR-21, miR-155, miR-191 and miR-221 in paired-sample t-test and the sensitivity/specificity of tests were over 90% in the case of miR-21 and miR-155 on the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Our results underline the role of miR-21 in OSCC and support the possible causal role of miR-155 and miR-221 in oral carcinogenesis. The overexpression of miR-191 is a novel finding in squamous cell carcinoma.
