The association between common genetic variant of microRNA-499 and cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis. Published data on the association between microRNA-499 (miR-499) rs3746444 T&gt;C polymorphism and cancer susceptibility are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of this relationship, a comprehensive meta-analysis was performed on nine published studies, with a total sample of 4,794 cases and 5,971 controls. Overall, no significant association was found between miR-499 polymorphism and cancer risk after all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. However, in the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant association with an increased risk was found in Asian (CC vs. TT: OR = 1.439, 95 % CI = 1.118-1.852, P = 0.005, p-heterogeneity = 0.116). Moreover, in the the subgroup analysis by cancer type, this SNP was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in the recessive model (OR = 1.077, 95 % CI = 1.008-1.151, P = 0.028, p-heterogeneity = 0.125). Our findings support the view that miR-499 rs3746444 T&gt;C polymorphism is associated with breast cancer and the C allele can increase cancer susceptibility in Asian.
