miR-764-5p promotes osteoblast differentiation through inhibition of CHIP/STUB1 expression. Differentiation of committed precursor cells into the osteoblast lineage is tightly regulated by several factors, including Runx2 and BMP2. We previously reported that C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein/STIP1 homology and U-Box containing protein 1 (CHIP/STUB1) negatively regulated osteoblast differentiation through promoting Runx2 protein degradation. However, how CHIP is regulated during osteoblast differentiation remains unknown. In this study, we found that miR-764-5p is up-expressed during the osteoblast differentiation in calvarial and osteoblast progenitor cells, coupled with down-expression of CHIP protein. We observed that forced expression or inhibition of miR-764-5p decreased or increased the CHIP protein level through affecting its translation by targeting the 3'-UTR region. Perturbation of miR-764-5p resulted in altered differentiation fate of osteoblast progenitor cells and the role of miR-764-5p was reversed by overexpression of CHIP, whereas depletion of CHIP impaired the effect of miR-764-5p. Our data showed that miR-764-5p positively regulates osteoblast differentiation from osteoblast progenitor cells by repressing the translation of CHIP protein.
