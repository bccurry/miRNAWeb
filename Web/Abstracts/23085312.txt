MicroRNAs in HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in multiple biological and metabolic processes. Recent studies suggested that miRNAs are critical in the maintenance of glomerular homeostasis in both physiological and pathological states. However, the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) has not been studied. In the present study, we have used a microarray-based approach in combination with real-time PCR to profile the miRNA expression patterns in HIV-1 transgenic mice (Tg26). Our results showed that 13 miRNAs, which belong to 11 miRNA families, were downregulated in HIVAN when compared with control mice. These miRNAs were classified into 20 functional categories. In in vitro studies, we examined the expression of specific miRNAs in HIV-1 transduced human podocytes. Our results showed that HIV-1 downregulated miRNA expression, specifically of miR-200 and miR-33. These studies suggest that miRNAs contributed to the development of the proliferative phenotype of HIVAN. Further functional analysis of these miRNAs in HIVAN animal model will not only enhance understanding of the pathogenesis but would also lead to the development of therapeutic strategies for HIVAN patients.
