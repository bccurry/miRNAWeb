Associations of miRNA polymorphisms and female physiological characteristics with breast cancer risk in Chinese population. mircoRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles on regulation of gene expressions. Aberrant expression of miRNAs was involved in various biological and pathological processes, including tumorigenesis of breast cancer. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were implicated in altered expression or biological functions of mature miRNAs. To explore the relevance of miRNA polymorphisms and female physiological characteristics to breast cancer risk, SNPs located within hsa-miR-605 (rs2043556), hsa-miR-149 (rs2292832), hsa-miR-27a (rs895819), hsa-miR-196a-2 (rs11614913) and hsa-miR-618 (rs2682818) were selected, and their associations with breast cancer risk were analysed. In addition, associations between physiological characteristics-related factors and breast cancer risk were estimated too. We found that the ones with menarche age less than 16 years had increased breast cancer risk (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.23-3.60). Marginally significant association between rs11614913 CT/CC genotypes and reduced breast cancer risk was observed (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.40-1.06), while no significance was detected about the other miRNA polymorphisms. We concluded that menarche at less than 16 years old increased breast cancer risk, while the genetic variants in miR-196-a-2 might decrease the risk.
