Involvement of miR-21 in resistance to daunorubicin by regulating PTEN expression in the leukaemia K562 cell line. Recent studies have shown microRNA-21 (miR-21) is overexpressed in several types of cancer and contributes to tumor resistance to chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated whether miR-21 mediated resistance of the leukaemia cell line K562 to the chemotherapeutic agent daunorubicin (DNR). miR-21 expression was upregulated in the DNR resistant cell line K562/DNR compared to its parental line K562. Stable transfection of miR-21 induced drug resistance in K562, while suppression of miR-21 in K562/DNR led to enhanced DNR cytotoxicity. Additional experiments indicate that the mechanism of miR-21 drug resistance involves the PI3K/Akt pathway and changes following PTEN protein expression. This study provides a novel mechanism for understanding leukaemia drug resistance.
