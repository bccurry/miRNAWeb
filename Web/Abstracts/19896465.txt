Circulating microRNA-1 as a potential novel biomarker for acute myocardial infarction. Recent studies have revealed the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in a variety of basic biological and pathological processes and the association of miRNA signatures with human diseases. Circulating miRNAs have been proposed as sensitive and informative biomarkers for multiple cancers diagnosis. We have previously documented aberrant up-regulation of miR-1 expression in ischemic myocardium and the consequent slowing of cardiac conduction. However, whether miR-1 could be a biomarker for predicting acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unclear. In the present study, we recruited 159 patients with or without AMI for quantification of miR-1 level in plasma using real-time RT-PCR method. We performed Wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank tests for comparison. Univariable linear regression and logistics regression analyses were performed to assess the potential correlation between miR-1 and known AMI markers. We also conducted receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis to evaluate the diagnostic ability of miR-1. We found that: miR-1 level was significantly higher in plasma from AMI patients compared with non-AMI subjects and the level was dropped to normal on discharge following medication. Increased circulating miR-1 was not associated with age, gender, blood pressure, diabetes mellitus or the established biomarkers for AMI. However, miR-1 level was well correlated with QRS by both univariable linear and logistics regression analyses. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.7740 for separation between non-AMI and AMI patients and 0.8522 for separation AMI patients under hospitalization and discharge. Collectively, our results revealed that circulating miR-1 may be a novel, independent biomarker for diagnosis of AMI.
