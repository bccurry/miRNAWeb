miR-346 controls release of TNF- protein and stability of its mRNA in rheumatoid arthritis via tristetraprolin stabilization. TNF- is a major cytokine implicated in rheumatoid arthritis. Its expression is regulated both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels and recent data demonstrated that miRNAs are implicated in TNF- response in macrophages. LPS-activated FLS isolated from RA patients express TNF- mRNA but not the mature protein. This prompted us to look for miRNAs which could be implicated in this anti-inflammatory effect. Using a microarray, we found two miRNAs, miR-125b and miR-939 predicted to target the 3'-UTR of TNF- mRNA, to be up-regulated in RA FLS in response to LPS, but their repression did not restore mature TNF- expression in FLS. We showed previously that miR-346, which is upregulated in LPS-activated FLS, inhibited Btk expression that stabilized TNF- mRNA. Blocking miR-346 reestablished TNF- expression in activated FLS. Interestingly, transfection of miR-346 in LPS-activated THP-1 cells inhibited TNF- secretion. We also demonstrated that TTP, a RNA binding protein which inhibited TNF- synthesis, is overexpressed in activated FLS and that inhibition of miR-346 decreases its expression. Conversely, transfection of miR-346 in LPS-activated THP-1 cells increased TTP mRNA expression and inhibited TNF- release. These results indicate that miR-346 controls TNF- synthesis by regulating TTP expression.
