Involvement of microRNA-29a in epigenetic regulation of transforming growth factor--induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial process during cancer invasion and metastasis, which is accompanied by the suppressed expression of E-cadherin initiated by stimuli such as TGF-. Recent studies have shown that the epigenetic regulation of E-cadherin could be an alternate mechanism of EMT induction in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MicroRNA-29a (miR-29a) is involved in the epigenetic regulation of genes by targeting DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which methylate CpG islands to suppress the transcription of genes. We studied the involvement of miR-29a in TGF- induced EMT in HCC cells. We treated human HCC cell lines with TGF- to induce EMT. To investigate DNA methylation in EMT, cells were treated with a methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) and methylation status of CpG islands in E-cadherin promoter was examined using methylation specific PCR. Precursor miR-29a (pre-miR-29a) was electroporated to force the expression of miR-29a in HCC cells in order to study the role of miR-29a in EMT. TGF- transformed HCC cells into a spindle-shape morphology accompanied by a decrease of E-cadherin with the induction of methylation of its promoter. Pretreatment of the cells with 5-Aza blocked this suppression of E-cadherin, indicating the involvement of DNA methylation. TGF- increased DNMT3B and DNMT1 and decreased miR-29a expression. The forced expression of miR-29a abrogated the suppression of E-cadherin induced by TGF-. miR-29a could regulate TGF--induced EMT by affecting DNA methylation via the suppression of DNMTs. These observations reveal the epigenetic regulation of genes by microRNA as a unique mechanism of EMT in HCC.
