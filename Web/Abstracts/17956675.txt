[DNA sequencing of miR-17-92 cluster at chromosome 13q31-q32 in mantel cell lymphoma cell lines]. This study was aimed to explore the characteristics of miR-17-92 cluster at chromosome 13q31-q32 in B cell malignant lymphoma and to investigate the changes of miR-17-92 cluster in B cell lymphoma at genome DNA level and its influence on expression of miR-17-92 cluster and relation with lymphoma occurrence. PCR and DNA sequencing were used to detect miR-17-92 cluster at chromosome 13q31-q32 in mantel cell lymphoma (MCL) cell lines Rec1, G519 and Z138. The results showed that DNA sequence of miR-17-92 cluster at chromosome 13q31-q32 in MCL cell lines were normal. It is concluded that there is no abnormal change in DNA sequence of miR-17-92 cluster which is not the mechanism for miR-17-92 cluster overexpression in mantel cell lymphoma cell lines.
