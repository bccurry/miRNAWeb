MicroRNA-21 gene and cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 18-27-nucleotides single-stranded RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. It has been demonstrated that miRNAs regulate a variety of physiological functions, including development, cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. There are growing evidence showed that miRNAs can affect the genesis and development of tumor and play a kind of tumor suppressor or oncogenic function by regulating its targetted gene-related signal pathway. miRNA-21 is one of the early discovered miRNAs in human cells, and the expression of miRNA-21 is significantly upregulated in different kinds of solid tumors. Its abnormal expression levels are closely associated with pathogenesis of cancers. This review summarizes the recent study on the field of miRNA-21 and its association with cancer.
