MicroRNA-16 targets zyxin and promotes cell motility in human laryngeal carcinoma cell line HEp-2. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate target mRNAs at the posttranscription level. Here, we show that miR-16 is upregulated in human laryngeal carcinoma tissues. Inhibition of miR-16 in HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cell line could suppress cell migration and enhance cell-cell adhesion. Subsequently, zyxin, whose expression is negatively regulated by miR-16, is confirmed to be a direct target gene of miR-16. Furthermore, overexpression of zyxin could also restrain cell movement and enhance cell-cell adhesion. The study of miR-16 and its target zyxin will shed light on diagnosis and therapy of laryngeal cancer.
