Pluripotent stem cell model reveals essential roles for miR-450b-5p and miR-184 in embryonic corneal lineage specification. Approximately 6 million people worldwide are suffering from severe visual impairments or blindness due to corneal diseases. Corneal allogeneic transplantation is often required to restore vision; however, shortage in corneal grafts and immunorejections remain major challenges. The molecular basis of corneal diseases is poorly understood largely due to lack of appropriate cellular models. Here, we described a robust differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from hair follicles or skin fibroblasts into corneal epithelial-like cells. We found that BMP4, coupled with corneal fibroblast-derived conditioned medium and collagen IV allowed efficient corneal epithelial commitment of hiPSCs in a manner that recapitulated corneal epithelial lineage development with high purity. Organotypic reconstitution assays suggested the ability of these cells to stratify into a corneal-like epithelium. This model allowed us identifying miR-450b-5p as a molecular switch of Pax6, a major regulator of eye development. miR-450b-5p and Pax6 were reciprocally distributed at the presumptive epidermis and ocular surface, respectively. miR-450b-5p inhibited Pax6 expression and corneal epithelial fate in vitro, altogether, suggesting that by repressing Pax6, miR-450b-5p triggers epidermal specification of the ectoderm, while its absence allows ocular epithelial development. Additionally, miR-184 was detectable in early eye development and corneal epithelial differentiation of hiPSCs. The knockdown of miR-184 resulted in a decrease in Pax6 and K3, in line with recent findings showing that a point mutation in miR-184 leads to corneal dystrophy. Altogether, these data indicate that hiPSCs are valuable for modeling corneal development and may pave the way for future cell-based therapy.
