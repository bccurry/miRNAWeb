Genome-wide analysis of miRNA expression reveals a potential role for miR-144 in brain aging and spinocerebellar ataxia pathogenesis. Neurodegenerative pathologies associated with aging exhibit clinical and morphological features that are relatively specific to humans. To gain insights into the evolution of the regulatory mechanisms of the aged brain, we compared age-related differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression levels in the cortex and cerebellum of humans, chimpanzees and rhesus macaques on a genome-wide scale. In contrast to global miRNA downregulation, a small subset of miRNAs was found to be selectively upregulated in the aging brain of all 3 species. Notably, miR-144 that is highly conserved appeared to be associated with the aging progression. Moreover, miR-144 plays a central role in regulating the expression of ataxin 1 (ATXN1), the disease-causing gene for the development spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). miRNA activity, including miR-144, -101 and -130 processing, was increased in the cerebellum and cortex of SCA1 and Alzheimer patients relative to healthy aged brains. Importantly, miR-144 and -101 inhibition increased ATXN1 levels in human cells. Thus, the activation of miRNA expression in the aging brain may serve to reduce the cytotoxic effect of polyglutamine expanded ATXN1 and the deregulation of miRNA expression may be a risk factor for disease development.
