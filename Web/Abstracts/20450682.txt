[Effect of microRNA on proliferation of human tongue carcinoma Tca8113 cells]. To investigate the effects of microRNA (miRNA) on proliferation of cultured human squamous cell carcinoma of tongue Tca8113 cells. The mimics or inhibitors of miRNA-31 or miRNA-139 were transfected into Tca8113 cells using liposome. Tca8113 cell proliferation was detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The absorbance (A) values of control group at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h were 0.125 +/- 0.002, 0.169 +/- 0.002 and 0.216 +/- 0.004, respectively. The mimics of miRNA-31 increased Tca8113 cell proliferation, with A values increasing to 0.136 +/- 0.001 (P &lt; 0.001), 0.186 +/- 0.004 (P &lt; 0.001) and 0.249 +/- 0.012 (P &lt; 0.01), respectively. The inhibitors of miRNA-139 also increased A values to 0.148 +/- 0.002 (P &lt; 0.001), 0.214 +/- 0.002 (P &lt; 0.001) and 0.250 +/- 0.009 (P &lt; 0.01), respectively. Contrast with these results, the inhibitors of miRNA-31 decreased Tca8113 cell proliferation, with A values decreasing to 0.145 +/- 0.001 and 0.155 +/- 0.011 (both of P &lt; 0.001) at 48 h and 72 h, respectively. The mimics of miRNA-139 also decreased A to 0.135 +/- 0.001 and 0.170 +/- 0.009 (both of P &lt; 0.001). miRNA-31 and miRNA-139 play an important role in the carcinogenesis of human tongue carcinomas. It may become a new method for the treatment of tongue carcinomas by adjustment the activities of miRNA.
