miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism is associated with cancer development among Asians and related to breast cancer susceptibility. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship between miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism (A&gt;G) and cancer risk, a meta-analysis was performed. A total of 9 studies including 6,077 cases and 7,199 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significantly elevated cancer risk was associated with miR-499 G allele when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (AG vs. AA: OR = 1.14, 95 % CI = 0.98-1.32; GG vs. AA: OR = 1.12, 95 % CI = 0.95-1.33; dominant model: OR = 1.13, 95 % CI = 0.99-1.29; recessive model: OR = 1.05, 95 % CI = 0.83-1.33). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risk was only found for Asians (dominant model: OR = 1.22, 95 % CI = 1.02-1.46). When stratified by study design, no statistically significantly elevated risks were found in hospital-based studies or population-based studies. In the subgroup analysis by cancer type, significant cancer risk change was only found for breast cancer when miR-499 G allele was included (dominant model: OR = 1.13, 95 % CI = 1.01-1.26). In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that the miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism (A&gt;G) is a low-penetrant risk factor for cancer development among Asians and may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility.
