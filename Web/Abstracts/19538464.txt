Spheroid-forming subpopulation of breast cancer cells demonstrates vasculogenic mimicry via hsa-miR-299-5p regulated de novo expression of osteopontin. The growth of cancer cells as multicellular spheroids has frequently been reported to mimic the in vivo tumour architecture and physiology and has been utilized to study antitumour drugs. In order to determine the distinctive characteristics of the spheroid-derived cells compared to the corresponding monolayer-derived cells, we enriched multicellular spheroid-forming subpopulations of cells from three human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MCF10AT and MCF10DCIS.com). These spheroid-derived cells were injected into female athymic nude mice to assess their tumorigenic potential and were profiled for their characteristic miRNA signature. We discovered that the spheroid-derived cells expressed increased levels of osteopontin (OPN), an oncogenic protein that has been clinically correlated with increased tumour burden and adverse prognosis in patients with breast cancer metastasis. Our studies further show that increased OPN levels are brought about in part, by decreased levels of hsa-mir-299-5p in the spheroid-forming population from all three cell lines. Moreover, the spheroid-forming cells can organize into vascular structures in response to nutritional limitation; these structures recapitulate a vascular phenotype by the expression of endothelial markers CD31, Angiopoeitin-1 and Endoglin. In this study, we have validated that hsa-mir-299-5p targets OPN; de novo expression of OPN in turn plays a critical role in enhancing proliferation, tumorigenicity and the ability to display vasculogenic mimicry of the spheroid-forming cells.
