MicroRNA-451 Inhibits Growth of Human Colorectal Carcinoma Cells via Downregulation of Pi3k/Akt Pathway. MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) play important roles in coordinating a variety of cellular processes and abnormal expression has been linked to the occurrence of several cancers. The miRNA miR-451 is downregulated in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells, suggested by several research groups including our own. In this study, synthetic miR-451 mimics were transfected into the SW620 human CRC cell line using Lipofectamine 2000 and expression of miR-451 was analyzed by real time PCR, while expression of CAB39, LKB1, AMPK, AKT, PI3K and Bcl2 was analyzed by Western blot, and cell growth was detected by MTT assay. In comparison to the controls, a significant increase in the expression of miR-451 was associated with significantly decreased expression of CAB39, LKB1, AMPK, AKT, PI3K and Bcl2. The capacity of cell proliferation was significantly decreased by miR-451 expression, which also inhibited cell growth. Our study confirmed that miR-451 has a repressive role in CRC cells by inhibiting cell growth through down-regulating the P13K/AKT pathway.
