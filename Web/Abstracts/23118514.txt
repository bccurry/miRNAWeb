miRNA589 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human peritoneal mesothelial cells. Background. microRNA (miRNA, miR) are thought to interact with multiple mRNAs which are involved in the EMT process. But the role of miRNAs in peritoneal fibrosis has remained unknown. Objective. To determine if miRNA589 regulates the EMT induced by TGF1 in human peritoneal mesothelial cell line (HMrSV5 cells). Methods. 1. Level of miR589 was detected in both human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) isolated from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients' effluent and HMrSV5 cells treated with or without TGF1. 2. HMrSV5 cells were divided into three groups: control group, TGF1 group, and pre-miR-589+TGF1 group. The level of miRNA589 was determined by realtime PCR. The expressions of ZO-1, vimentin, and E-cadherin in HPMCs were detected, respectively. Results. Decreased level of miRNA589 was obtained in either HPMCs of long-term CAPD patients or HMrSV5 cells treated with TGF1. In vitro, TGF1 led to upregulation of vimentin and downregulation of ZO-1 as well as E-cadherin in HMrSV5 cells, which suggested EMT, was induced. The changes were accompanied with notably decreased level of miRNA589 in HMrSV5 cells treated with TGF1. Overexpression of miRNA589 by transfection with pre-miRNA589 partially reversed these EMT changes. Conclusion. miRNA589 mediates TGF1 induced EMT in human peritoneal mesothelial cells.
