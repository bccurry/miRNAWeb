[Expression of mir-21 and mir-375 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma]. The aims of the present study are to determine the microRNA expression signature in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and the association with clinical features of this disease. We analyzed the microRNA expression profiles in LSCC and adjacent normal tissue. The chip results were further verified by quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction. We analyzed the association between the expression of mir-21,mir-375 and the clinic features. Initial analysis by gene expression microarray revealed that mir-21 was one of most up-regulated microRNAs in LSCC and mir-375 was down-regulated. The expression of mir-21 and mir-375 were validated by qRT-PCR. The expression of mir-21 was significantly raise in tumors (P &lt; 0.01), while the expression of mir-375 was decrease in tumors (P &lt; 0.01). The up-regulation of mir-21 in LSCC was shown to be associated with clinical pathologic stages of these patients (P &lt; 0.05). The high expression of mir-21 was associated with clinical feature of smoking (P &lt; 0.05). Characteristics such as age, sex, clinical stages and alcohol were analyzed according to the expression of mir-21, mir-375 but no difference was observed. mir-21 is a putative oncogenic RNA in head and neck cancer. The mutation of mir-21 may be involved in the oncogenesis and differentiation of LSCC. Our study may helpful clarify a great potential for the use of mir-21 profiling as a prognostic marker in predicting the post-surgical outcome.
