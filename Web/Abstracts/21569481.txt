Down-regulation of miR-27a might inhibit proliferation and drug resistance of gastric cancer cells. Here we aimed to firstly investigate the role of miR-27a in proliferation and multidrug resistance of gastric cancer cells. The role of miR-27a in gastric cancer cells was detected using MTT assay, soft agar assay, flow cytometry assay, nude mice assay, real-time PCR, western blot and reporter gene assay, etc. Down-regulation of miR-27a could inhibit porliferation of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Down-regulation of miR-27a could also confer sensitivity of drugs on gastric cancer cells, and might increase accumulation and decrease releasing amount of adriamycin in gastric cancer cells. Down-regulation of miR-27a could significantly decrease the expression of P-glycoprotein and the transcriptional activity of cyclin D1, and up-regulate the expression of p21. MiR-27a might play important roles in porliferation and drug resistance of gastric cancer. MiR-27a might be considered as a useful target for cancer therapy.
