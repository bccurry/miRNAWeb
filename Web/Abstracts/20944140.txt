Importance of miR-20a expression in prostate cancer tissue. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are endogenously expressed regulatory noncoding RNAs, have an altered expression in tumor tissues. MiRNAs regulate cancer-related processes such as cell growth and tissue differentiation, and therefore, might function as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. The aim of our study was to assess the expression of mir-20a, let-7a, miR-15a and miR-16 in prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue and to investigate the relation between the expression of miRNAs and the clinicopathological features of PCa. The study group comprised 138 patients: 85 patients with BPH and 53 patients with PCa. The total RNA was isolated from the tissue specimen core and miRNA expressions were quantified using a real-time RT-PCR method (TaqMan MicroRNA Assays). U6snRNA was used for the normalization of the miRNA expression. miR-20a expression was significantly higher in the group of patients with a Gleason score of 7-10 in comparison with the group of patients with a Gleason score of 0-6 (p=0.0082). We found no statistical differences in the miRNA expressions (mir-20a, let-7a, miR-15a and miR-16) in the PCa tissue samples in comparison with the BPH tissue samples. Our result shows that the more dedifferentiated PCa cells have a higher expression of miR-20a and this supports the oncogenic role of miR-20a in PCa carcinogenesis. The evaluation of miRNA expression could yield new information about PCa pathogenesis.
