Coordinated silencing of MYC-mediated miR-29 by HDAC3 and EZH2 as a therapeutic target of histone modification in aggressive B-Cell lymphomas. We investigated the transcriptional and epigenetic repression of miR-29 by MYC, HDAC3, and EZH2 in mantle cell lymphoma and other MYC-associated lymphomas. We demonstrate that miR-29 is repressed by MYC through a corepressor complex with HDAC3 and EZH2. MYC contributes to EZH2 upregulation via repression of the EZH2 targeting miR-26a, and EZH2 induces MYC via inhibition of the MYC targeting miR-494 to create positive feedback. Combined inhibition of HDAC3 and EZH2 cooperatively disrupted the MYC-EZH2-miR-29 axis, resulting in restoration of miR-29 expression, downregulation of miR-29-targeted genes, and lymphoma growth suppression in vitro and in vivo. These findings define a MYC-mediated miRNA repression mechanism, shed light on MYC lymphomagenesis mechanisms, and reveal promising therapeutic targets for aggressive B-cell malignancies.
