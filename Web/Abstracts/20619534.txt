miR-126 functions as a tumour suppressor in human gastric cancer. MicroRNAs have emerged as important gene regulators and are recognised as key players in carcinogenesis. In the present study, we show that miR-126 was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with matched normal tissues and was associated with clinicopathological features, including tumour size, lymph node metastasis, local invasion and tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Ectopic expression of miR-126 in SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells potently inhibited cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, migration and invasion in vitro as well as tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, we identified the adaptor protein Crk as a target of miR-126. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-126 may function as a tumour suppressor in gastric cancer, with Crk as a direct target.
