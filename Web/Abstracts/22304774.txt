[Construction of a recombined adenovirus vector carrying pri-miR-21 gene and research on it's target gene TLR4]. To construct the recombined adenovirus vector carrying pri-miR-21 gene, which can express mature miR-21 efficiently, and to study the interaction of miR- 21 with its target gene TLR4. Using healthy mouse's gDNA as template, the primary miR-21 coding sequence was amplified by PCR and cloned into a shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV. Constructed plasmid was sequenced and linearized for homologous recombination with pAdEasy-1 vector in BJ5183 bacteria. The recombined adenovirus vector carrying pri-miR-21 gene was used to challenge HeLa cell. The candidate target gene of miR-21 was determined by miRNA analysis databases. The expression level of TLR4 protein was detected by western blotting. Through the PCR, restriction enzyme digestion, DNA sequencing and expression of GFP, recombinant adenoviral vector pri-miR-21 gene was constructed successfully. Bioinformatic analysis suggested a few possible binding sites between miR-21 and TLR4. Results showed that miR-21 down-regulated TLR4 at protein levels. The recombinant adenoviral vector containing pri- miR-21 was successfully constructed. miR-21 gene interfered with the expression of TLR4 target gene.
