Epistasis between microRNAs 155 and 146a during T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. An increased understanding of antitumor immunity is necessary for improving cell-based immunotherapies against human cancers. Here, we investigated the roles of two immune system-expressed microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-155 and miR-146a, in the regulation of antitumor immune responses. Our results indicate that miR-155 promotes and miR-146a inhibits interferon  (IFN) responses by T cells and reduces solid tumor growth in vivo. Using a double-knockout (DKO) mouse strain deficient in both miR-155 and miR-146a, we have also identified an epistatic relationship between these two miRNAs. DKO mice had defective T cell responses and tumor growth phenotypes similar to miR-155(-/-) mice. Further analysis of the T cell compartment revealed that miR-155 modulates IFN expression through a mechanism involving repression of Ship1. Our work reveals critical roles for miRNAs in the reciprocal regulation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor immunity and demonstrates the dominant nature of miR-155 during its promotion of immune responses.
