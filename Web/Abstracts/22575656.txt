microRNA-210 negatively regulates LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines by targeting NF-B1 in murine macrophages. Ligation of TLR4 with LPS in macrophages leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which are central to eliminate viral and bacterial infection. However, uncontrolled TLR4 activation may contribute to pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as septic shock. In this study, we found microRNA-210 was induced in murine macrophages by LPS. Transfection of miR-210 mimics significantly inhibited LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, transfection of anti-miR-210 inhibitors increased LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-210 targets NF-B1. Therefore, our data identify miR-210 as a very important feedback negative regulator for LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines.
