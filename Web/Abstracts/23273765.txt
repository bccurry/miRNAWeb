Shared gene regulation during human somatic cell reprogramming. Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have the ability to differentiate into all somatic cells and to maintain unlimited self-renewal. Therefore, they have great potential in both basic research and clinical therapy for many diseases. To identify potentially universal mechanisms of human somatic cell reprogramming, we studied gene expression changes in three types of cells undergoing reprogramming. The set of 570 genes commonly regulated during induction of iPS cells includes known embryonic stem (ES) cell markers and pluripotency related genes. We also identified novel genes and biological categories which may be related to somatic cell reprogramming. For example, some of the down-regulated genes are predicted targets of the pluripotency microRNA cluster miR302/367, and the proteins from these putative target genes interact with the stem cell pluripotency factor POU5F1 according to our network analysis. Our results identified candidate gene sets to guide research on the mechanisms operating during somatic cell reprogramming.
