[MicroRNAs can be expressed in cardiomyocyte-like cells differentiated from human mesenchymal stem cells]. To investigate the expression of representative heart-specific primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) in the cardiomyocyte-like cells differentiated from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The phenotype of hMSCs isolated was identified by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies against FITC-conjugated CD29, CD34, and CD11b. The third-passage hMSCs were induced to differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells by 5-azacytidine and indirect coculture with neonatal rat myocytes, respectively. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed to detect the expression of the cardiac-specific proteins, namely cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and sarcomeric alpha-actinin, in the cardiomyocyte-like cells differentiated from hMSCs. RT-PCR and DNA sequencing were used to identify the expression of the 5 representative heart-specific pri-miRNAs. High hMSC marker CD29 expression rate (98.87%) and low hematopoietic cell markers CD34 (5%) and CD11b (0.4%) expression rates were identified in the hMSCs isolated. cTnI and sarcomeric alpha-actinin expression occurred in the hMSCs following induction with the 2 differentiation-inducing methods. miRNA-143 and -181 expressions were induced in the hMSCs by 5-azacytidine and miRNA-143, -181, -206, and -208 expressions were induced by indirect coculture with neonatal rat myocytes, but pri-miRNA-1-2 expression failed to be induced by these two induction methods. Expressions of the representative heart-specific pri-miRNAs in different patterns can be induced in cardiomyocyte-like cells differentiated from hMSCs by 5-azacytidine and indirect coculture with neonatal rat myocytes.
