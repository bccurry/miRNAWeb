Correlation between pre-miR-146a C/G polymorphism and gastric cancer risk in Chinese population. To investigate the association between pre-miR-146a C/G polymorphism and gastric cancer risk. We performed a hospital-based, case-control study using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method in 608 individuals (304 gastric cancer patients and 304 age and sex matched cancer-free controls). The frequencies of pre-miR-146a C/G genotypes in the case group were significantly different from those in the control groups (P = 0.037). Compared with CC genotype carriers, subjects with the variant genotypes (GC + GG) had a 58% increased risk of gastric cancer (adjusted OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.11-2.20, P = 0.009). Moreover, a higher gastric cancer risk was especially evident in younger individuals aged &lt; or =58 years, nonsmokers, and males (adjusted OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.08-2.87, P = 0.024; adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.06-2.28, P = 0.025; adjusted OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.04-2.27, P = 0.033; respectively). Pre-miR-146a C/G polymorphism might be associated with an elevated risk of gastric cancer in Chinese population.
