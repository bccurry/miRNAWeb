MicroRNAs and DNA damage response: implications for cancer therapy. The DNA damage response (DDR) pathways play critical roles in protecting the genome from DNA damage. Abrogation of DDR often results in elevated genomic instability and cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Many proteins involved in DDR are subjected to precise regulation at multiple levels, such as transcriptional control and posttranslational modifications, in response to DNA damage. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The expression levels of some miRNAs change in response to DNA damage. Some miRNAs, such as miR-24, 138, 96 and 182, have been implicated in DDR and/or DNA repair and affect cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In this review, we summarize recent findings related to the emerging roles of miRNAs in regulating DDR and DNA repair and discuss their potential in cancer therapy.
