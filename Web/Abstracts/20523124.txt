The pro-differentiating role of miR-124: indicating the road to become a neuron. miRNAs are essential post-transcriptional modulators affecting cell identity and fate, with a central role in cellular and developmental processes. The brain-enriched neuronal specific miRNAs-124 has been identified as a promoter of neuronogenesis in various conditions, in vitro and in vivo, with a potential role in regulating also activities of post-mitotic neurons, such as synaptic plasticity and memory formation. In this point of view, we recapitulate the main experimental findings substantiating the positive correlation between miR-124 expression and neuronogenesis progression. Then, we describe the impact of miR-124 on the molecular network driving the profound changes which take place in differentiating neuronal cells. Finally, we consider the possibility of a post-transcriptional modulation of miR-124 biogenesis, which may finely regulate--in turn--the activities of miR-124 in neural precursor cells.
