[Differential expression profile of microRNA between hyperplastic scar and normal skin]. To explore the miRNA differential expression profiles of hyperplastic scar and normal skin so as to further elucidate the pathogenesis of hyperplastic scar and search for new therapeutic targets. The total RNA was extracted from 5 human hyperplastic scar and normal skin tissues by Trizol. The specimens were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from November 2010 to May 2011, and purified by mirVana(TM) miRNA Isolation Kit and then labeled and hybridized by miRNA Complete Labeling and Hyb Kit. The images of hybridization were analyzed by the Feature Extraction (v10.7) software and the microarray results confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In hyperplastic scar, 92 miRNA genes were up-regulated and 13 down-regulated. The most significantly up-regulated miRNAs were hsa-miR-564 and hsa-miR-936, etc. while hsa-miR-451, hsa-miR-223, hsa-miR-363 and hsa-miR-29b-1* became significantly down-regulated. The findings of RT-PCR on hsa-miR-21 and hsa-miR-451 of regulation were in a high concordance with the microarray results. Distinct differences of miRNA expression between human hyperplastic scar and normal skin, it may be closely correlated with the formation, development and evolution of hyperplastic scar.
