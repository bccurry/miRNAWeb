Changes in microRNA expression in rat lungs caused by sevoflurane anesthesia: a TaqMan low-density array study. Reportedly, a large number of microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Sevoflurane is routinely used to various patients, and its safety has been confirmed by clinical outcomes; however, its effects to lungs at the miRNA level have not been elucidated. In our previous genomic studies, we showed that sevoflurane anesthesia affected the expression of many genes and mRNAs in rat lungs. In this study, we comprehensively investigated changes in miRNA expression caused by sevoflurane anesthesia (2.0% and 4.0%). Sevoflurane anesthesia resulted in apparent changes in miRNA expression in rat lungs, and the pattern of 2.0% sevoflurane-induced changes in miRNA expression was similar to that of 4.0% sevoflurane. Some of the differentially expressed miRNAs are known to be involved in asthma, IPF, and PAH. Especially, miR-146a, the most up-regulated miRNA, is known to attenuate the toxic effects associated with LPS stimulation. We showed, for the first time, dynamic changes in miRNA expression caused by sevoflurane anesthesia, and moreover, our results were important to understand the influence of sevoflurane anesthesia on any patients suffered from various lung diseases.
