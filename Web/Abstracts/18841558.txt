[The mechanism of apoptosis in human U87 glioma cells induced by miR-21 antisense oligonucleotide]. To investigate the mechanism of U87 cell apoptosis induced by inhibiting miR-21 expression. Antisense oligonucleotides of miR-21 were chemically synthesized and transfected into U87 cells. The apoptosis, proliferation, and invasion of the cells were evaluated. The relationship between miR-21 and PTEN or caspase was identified by bioinformatics and Western blot. Inhibiting miR-21 expression led to U87 cell growth suppression, apoptosis induction, invasion reduction, caspase-3 activity elevation and caspase-9 activation, but did not affect PTEN and caspase-8 expression. miR-21 may function as an antiapoptotic miRNA in U87 cells. Inhibiting miR-21 expression could induce U87 cell apoptosis via caspase-9 and 3 activation, but not PTEN activation.
