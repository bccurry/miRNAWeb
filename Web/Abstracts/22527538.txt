Increased microRNA-221/222 and decreased estrogen receptor  in the cervical portion of the uterosacral ligaments from women with pelvic organ prolapse. The aim of this study was to compare the expression of microRNA (miR)-221, miR-222, and estrogen receptor  (ER) in the uterosacral ligaments of women with and without pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Histologically confirmed full-thickness uterosacral ligament biopsies were procured during hysterectomies from 40 POP patients and 40 postmenopausal women without prolapse. Expression of miR-221/222 was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and ER protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The mean expression levels of miR-221/222 both increased by approximately twofold in women with POP relative to controls, while ER protein levels in POP patients were significantly lower than controls. Negative correlations were observed between ER protein expression and both miR-221 (r = -0.8542) and miR-222 (r = -0.861) in POP patients. Elevated miR-221/222 expression levels are associated with, and may be responsible for, reduced ER expression in the cervical portion of uterosacral ligaments of patients with POP. MiR-221/222 may serve as potential therapeutic targets for POP.
