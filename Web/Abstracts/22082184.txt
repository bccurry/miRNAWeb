Age-related decrease of miRNA-92a levels in human CD8+ T-cells correlates with a reduction of nave T lymphocytes. ABSTRACT: MicroRNA (miR)-17-92a expression plays a crucial role in lymphocyte ontogeny. We therefore set out to determine miR-92a expression levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy subjects to ascertain any association between these levels and ageing. We found a positive correlation between the miR-92a expression level and the percentages of RO-CD8+CD27+ (P = 0.0046) and CD3+CD8+CD62L+ (P = 0.0011). This suggests that the majority of miR-92a of CD8+ T cells is derived from nave cells, and the miR-92a expression level in CD8+ T cells declines progressively with age. These results indicate that the age-related attrition of nave T cells is linked to a reduction of miR-92a in human T -lymphocytes. Therefore, we should careful attention when evaluating human miRNA levels in T lymphocytes to use normal control values.
