Human cytosolic tRNase ZL can downregulate gene expression through miRNA. A long form of tRNase Z (tRNase ZL) can cleave any target RNA at any desired site under the direction of artificial small guide RNA including approximately 25-nucleotide hook-shaped RNA. Here we show that human miR-103 can form a hook structure to guide target RNA cleavage by human cytosolic tRNase ZL in vitro. In vivo analyses using luciferase mRNAs modified to contain miR-103 target sequences in their 3' untranslated regions indicated that miR-103 downregulates gene expression through directing mRNA cleavage by tRNase ZL. The present data suggest the possibility that human cytosolic tRNase ZL modulates gene expression through a subset of microRNAs in the cells.
