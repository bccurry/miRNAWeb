MicroRNA-7 regulates glioblastoma cell invasion via targeting focal adhesion kinase expression. Invasion growth is the most characteristic biological phenotype of glioblastoma, but the molecular mechanism in glioma cell invasion is poorly understood. Recent data have showed that microRNA plays an essential role in tumor invasion. Our study aimed to explore the mechanism of miR-7 involved in the control of glioblastoma cell invasion. Glioma cell invasion was evaluated by transwell and scratch assays after up-regulation of miR-7 using miR-7 mimics in U87 and U251 cells. Luciferase reporter assay was used to determine focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as a target of miR-7. The levels of miR-7, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 mRNA were detected by PCR assay, and the levels of FAK, MMP-2, MMP-9, total and phosphorylation serine/threonine kinase (AKT), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 were measured by Western blotting analysis. Over-expression of miR-7 inhibited the invasion and migration activity of U87 and U251 cells. And up-regulation of miR-7 reduced FAK protein expression, Further, luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-7 modulated FAK expression directly by binding 3'UTR of FAK mRNA. In addition, miR-7 repressed p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT level, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Finally, the inverse relationship between FAK and miR-7 expression was certificated in human glioma tissues. To our knowledge, these data indicate for the first time that miR-7 directly regulates cell invasion by targeting FAK in glioblastoma and that miR-7 could be a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma intervention.
