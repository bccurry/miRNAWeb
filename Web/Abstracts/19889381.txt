MicroRNA expression profiling of the human uterine cervix after term labor and delivery. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional regulation of target genes. The objective of this study was to determine the miRNA expression profile of the human uterine cervix after spontaneous term labor (TL). The miRNA expression pattern of cervical tissue was characterized using microarrays. Samples were collected at term from patients with (n = 8) and without (n = 9) TL. Moderated t tests and false discovery rate correction were applied. Results were confirmed using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A total of 226 miRNAs were expressed in human cervical tissue. miR-223, miR-34b, and miR-34c were overexpressed in cervical tissue of patients with TL compared to those without. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays confirmed these findings (miR-223 [fold change {FC} = 5.7], miR-34b [FC = 4.5], miR-34c [FC = 6.2]; P &lt; .001). This is the first report of miRNA expression in the human uterine cervix in pregnancy. Cervical remodeling after TL and delivery was associated with changes in miR-223, miR-34b, and miR-34c.
