Immunophenotype-related microRNA expression in canine chronic lymphocytic leukemia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are posttranscriptional regulatory noncoding RNAs used to profile human hematopoietic tumors. In this study, some mature miRNAs was quantitated in peripheral blood from dogs with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Relative expression data were normalised against four endogenous controls (let-7a, miR-17-5p, miR-26b, and miR-223) selected by geNorm analysis. The results revealed distinct miRNA patterns in CLL depending on the immunophenotype. Also in dogs, the different miRNAs expression could reflect developmental lineage and tumor differentiation. The similar genetics, physiology and exposure to environment in dogs and humans make the miRNA expression study in canine CLL attractive for comparative oncology.
