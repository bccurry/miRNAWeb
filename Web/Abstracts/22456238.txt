Integrated analysis of gene copy number, copy neutral LOH, and microRNA profiles in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We adopted an integrated analysis of gene copy number alterations (CNAs), copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN LOH), and microRNA (miRNA) profiling in 21 adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. This study revealed the most frequent CNAs to be at chromosomes 9p, 7, and 17 and recurrent CNN LOH at 5p, 9p, and Xq. As for the most differentially expressed miRNAs, they included 8 upregulated and 14 downregulated miRNAs, of which miR-148a at 7p15.2, miR-22 at 17p13.3, miR-223 at Xq12, as well as miR-101-2 at 9p24.1 exhibited recurrent CNAs or CNN LOH. miR-101-2 was recurrently downregulated, and although the related CNN LOH was detected only in BCR-ABL1 negative cases (2/14), deletions of miR-101-2 were observed solely in BCR-ABL1 positive cases (4/7). Finally, BCR-ABL1 positive cases, in contrast to negative ones, were characterized by slightly, but still significantly, higher expression levels of miR-29b.
