MicroRNA-122: a therapeutic target for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Hepatitis C virus infection is the main cause of liver disease worldwide, often leading to chronic hepatitis. Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNA-122, a liver-specific miRNA, is required for HCV replication in hepatocytes by its binding to the 5' UTR of HCV. Down-regulation of miRNA-122 in vitro and in vivo has led to significant inhibition of viral replication. In the present article, we report the major recent findings on the potential therapeutic role of anti-miRNA-122 molecules.
