MicroRNA-488 regulates zinc transporter SLC39A8/ZIP8 during pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Even though osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal dysfunction, there are no effective pharmacological treatments to treat OA due to lack of understanding in OA pathology. To better understand the mechanism in OA pathogenesis and investigate its effective target, we analyzed miRNA profiles during OA pathogenesis and verify the role and its functional targets of miR-488. Human articular chondrocytes were obtained from cartilage of OA patients undergoing knee replacement surgery and biopsy samples of normal cartilage and the expression profile of miRNA was analyzed. From expression profile, most potent miR was selected and its target and functional role in OA pathogenesis were investigated using target validation system and OA animal model system. Among miRNAs tested, miR-488 was significantly decreased in OA chondrocytes Furthermore, we found that exposure of IL-1 was also suppressed whereas exposure of TGF-3 induced the induction of miR-488 in human articular chondrocytes isolated from biopsy samples of normal cartilages. Target validation study showed that miR-488 targets ZIP8 and suppression of ZIP8 in OA animal model showed the reduced cartilage degradation. Target validation study showed that miR-488 targets ZIP8 and suppression of ZIP8 in OA animal model showed the reduced cartilage degradation. miR-488 acts as a positive role for chondrocyte differentiation/cartilage development by inhibiting MMP-13 activity through targeting ZIP-8.
