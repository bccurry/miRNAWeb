Determination of miRNA targets in skeletal muscle cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small 22 nucleotide noncoding RNAs which regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by either destabilizing and consequently degrading their targeted mRNAs or by repressing their translation. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs are essential for normal mammalian development, homeostasis, and many other functions. In addition, deleterious changes in miRNA expression were associated with human diseases. Several muscle-specific miRNAs, including miR-1, miR-133, miR-206, and miR-208, have been shown to be important for normal myoblast differentiation, proliferation, and muscle remodeling in response to stress. They have also been implicated in various cardiac and skeletal muscular diseases. miRNA-based gene therapies hold great potential for the treatment of cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases. Herein, we describe methods commonly applied to study the biological role of miRNAs, as well as techniques utilized to manipulate miRNA expression and to investigate their target regulation.
