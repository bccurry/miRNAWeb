MicroRNA 16 enhances differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in a cardiac niche toward myogenic phenotypes in vitro. Upregulation of microRNA 16 (miR-16) contributed to the differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) toward myogenic phenotypes in a cardiac niche, the present study aimed to determine the role of miR-16 in this process. hMSCs and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were co-cultured indirectly in two chambers to set up a cardiac microenvironment (niche). miRNA expression profile in cardiac-niche-induced hMSCs was detected by miRNA microarray. Cardiac marker expression and cell cycle analysis were determined in different treatment hMSCs. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were used to identify the expression of mRNA, mature miRNA and protein of interest. miRNA dysregulation was shown in hMSCs after cardiac niche induction. miR-16 was upregulated in cardiac-niche-induced hMSCs. Overexpression of miR-16 significantly increased G1-phase arrest of the cell cycle in hMSCs and enhanced the expression of cardiac marker genes, including GATA4, NK2-5, MEF2C and TNNI3. Differentiation-inducing factor 3 (DIF-3), a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest compound, was used to induce G1 phase arrest in cardiac-niche-induced hMSCs, and the expression of cardiac marker genes was up-regulated in DIF-3-treated hMSCs. The expression of CCND1, CCND2 and CDK6 was suppressed by miR-16 in hMSCs. CDK6, CCND1 or CCND2 knockdown resulted in G1 phase arrest in hMSCs and upregulation of cardiac marker gene expression in hMSCs in a cardiac niche. miR-16 enhances G1 phase arrest in hMSCs, contributing to the differentiation of hMSCs toward myogenic phenotypes when in a cardiac niche. This mechanism provides a novel strategy for pre-modification of hMSCs before hMSC-based transplantation therapy for severe heart diseases.
