microRNA-7 increases radiosensitivity of human cancer cells with activated EGFR-associated signaling. Many microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in regulating expression of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in a wide range of solid tumors and is an important therapeutic target; however, the therapeutic outcome of currently available anti-EGFR agents is often limited due to diverse molecular resistance mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the potential of targeting miRNA-7 for overcoming radio-resistance of cancer cells with activated EGFR-associated signaling. A panel of human cancer cell lines with increased EGFR-PI3K-Akt signaling was transfected with pre-miR-7 or control miRNA. Ectopic overexpression of miR-7 attenuated EGFR and Akt expression and radiosensitized SQ20B squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, A549 lung carcinoma cells, and U251 and U87 malignant glioma cells. In contrast, antisense-mediated inhibition of mature miR-7 expression led up-regulation of EGFR and its downstream effectors, and increased radio-resistance of U251 glioma cells. Overexpression of miR-7 prolonged radiation-induced H2AX foci formation and downregulation of DNA-dependent protein kinases (DNA-PKcs). miR-7 may be a useful therapeutic target for overcoming the radio-resistance of human cancers with activated EGFR-PI3K-AKT signaling.
