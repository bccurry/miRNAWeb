[The role of micro-RNA/143/145 in evolution of intra-stent restenosis]. The mechanisms of neointima formation and hyperplasia in restenosis remain non-elucidated yet. Because micro-ribonucleic acids/143/145(micro-RNA/143 and micro-RNA/145) participate in the regulation and sustaining of the genotype of mature vascular myocytes we have measured their expression in tissue content of restenoses taken postmortem from 5 patients who underwent angioplasty and subsequently died, and studied its association with actin quantity and fibrillar collagen type I degradation degree. It has been found that during restenosis progression quantity of micro-RNA/143 and micro-RNA/145 decreases in media and intima of coronary artery. This finding has been associated with appearance in coronary intima of coronary myocytes with reduced size likely of secretory phenotype, diminution of number of myocytes with contractile phenotype, and increase of quantity of denaturized collagen type I-phenomena characteristic for neointima hyperplasia, a substrate of intra-stent restenosis.
