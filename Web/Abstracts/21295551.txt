Expression of serum miR-221 in human hepatocellular carcinoma and its prognostic significance. To investigate whether the serum miR-221 expression correlates with clinicopathologic features and the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Four miRNAs (miR-221, miR-222, miR-21 and miR-224) related to HCC were selected in the present study. Serum miRNA expression was investigated in 46 HCC patients and 20 healthy normal controls by using real-time PCR technique, and then correlations between miR-221 expression and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of HCC patients were evaluated. The four miRNAs were found to be differentially overexpressed in HCC serum samples, and high level of miR-221 expression was correlated with tumor size (P&lt;0.001), cirrhosis (P=0.003) and tumor stage (P=0.016). In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the overall survival rate of the high miR-221 expression group (27.6%) was significantly lower than that of the low miR-221 expression group (62.3%, P&lt;0.05). Serum miR-221, upregulated in HCC, can provide predictive significance for prognosis of HCC patients.
