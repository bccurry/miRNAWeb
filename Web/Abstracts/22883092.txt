[MicroRNAs expression in normal and dissected aortic tissue]. To investigate if there is altered microRNAs (miRNAs) expression in aortic dissection (Debakey Type A) and normal aorta tissue. Total RNA was exacted from aorta of 5 patients with aortic dissection (AD) and four patients without aortic diseases (NA). miRNAs of the aortic tissues were analyzed by miRNA microarray. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to verify the expression of miRNAs in larger sample size (AD = 11 and NA = 9). hsa-miR-146b-5p_st, hsa-miR-19a_st and hsa-miR-505_st were significantly upregulated while hsa-miR-1268_st and hsa-miR-939_st were significantly downregulated [fold change &gt; 2, q-value (%)  5] in AD group compared with NA group. RT-PCR verified hsa-miR-146b-5p_st miRNAs change in AD group. Altered miRNAs expression might play an essential role in the pathogenesis of aortic dissection formation and hsa-miR-146b-5p_st might serve as a new diagnosis biomarker of aortic dissection.
