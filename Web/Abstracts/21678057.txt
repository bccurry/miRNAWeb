miR-29a and miR-142-3p downregulation and diagnostic implication in human acute myeloid leukemia. Expression profiling of microRNAs (miRNAs) in most diseases might be popular and provide the possibility for diagnostic implication, but few studies have accurately quantified the expression level of dysregulated miRNAs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we analyzed the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 AML patients (subtypes M1 to M5) and six normal controls by miRNA microarray and identified several differentially expressed miRNAs. Among them miR-29a and miR-142-3p were selectively encountered in Northern blot analysis and their significantly decreased expression in AML was further confirmed. Quantitative real-time PCR in 52 primarily diagnosed AML patients and 100 normal controls not only verified the expression properties of these 2 miRNAs, but also established that the expression level of miR-142-3p and miR-29a in PBMCs could be used as novel diagnostic markers. A better diagnostic outcome was achieved by combining miR-29a and miR-142-3p with about 90% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.97. Our results provide insights into the involvement of miRNAs in leukemogenesis, and offer candidates for AML diagnosis and therapeutic strategy.
