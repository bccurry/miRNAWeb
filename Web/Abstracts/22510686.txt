miR-484 regulates mitochondrial network through targeting Fis1. Mitochondria constantly undergo fusion and fission, two necessary processes for the maintenance of organelle fidelity. The abnormal mitochondrial fission participates in the pathogenesis of many diseases, but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here we show that miR-484 can suppress translation of mitochondrial fission protein Fis1, and inhibit Fis1-mediated fission and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and in the adrenocortical cancer cells. We demonstrate that Fis1 is necessary for mitochondrial fission and apoptosis, and is upregulated during anoxia, whereas miR-484 is downregulated. miR-484 is able to attenuate Fis1 upregulation and mitochondrial fission, by binding to the amino acid coding sequence of Fis1 and inhibiting its translation. In exploring the underlying mechanism of miR-484 downregulation upon apoptosis, we observe that Foxo3a transactivates miR-484 expression. Foxo3a transgenic or knockout mice exhibit, respectively, a high or low level of miR-484 and a reduced or enhanced mitochondrial fission, apoptosis and myocardial infarction. Our data reveal a model of mitochondrial fission regulation by a microRNA.
