A microRNA expression signature for cervical cancer prognosis. Invasive cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, resulting in about 300,000 deaths each year. The clinical outcomes of cervical cancer vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, a method to reliably predict disease outcome would be important for individualized therapy by identifying patients with high risk of treatment failures before therapy. In this study, we have identified a microRNA (miRNA)-based signature for the prediction of cervical cancer survival. miRNAs are a newly identified family of small noncoding RNAs that are extensively involved in human cancers. Using an established PCR-based miRNA assay to analyze 102 cervical cancer samples, we identified miR-200a and miR-9 as two miRNAs that could predict patient survival. A logistic regression model was developed based on these two miRNAs and the prognostic value of the model was subsequently validated with independent cervical cancers. Furthermore, functional studies were done to characterize the effect of miRNAs in cervical cancer cells. Our results suggest that both miR-200a and miR-9 could play important regulatory roles in cervical cancer control. In particular, miR-200a is likely to affect the metastatic potential of cervical cancer cells by coordinate suppression of multiple genes controlling cell motility.
