The hsa-miR-5739 modulates the endoglin network in endothelial cells derived from human embryonic stem cells. MicroRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs that bind to seed sequences on the 3' untranslated regions of their target genes and then negatively regulate gene expressions via the RISC complex. The novel miRNA, hsa-miR-5739, was cloned and characterized its function and cellular expression in current study. The hsa-miR-5739 downregulated endothelial cells that were derived from human ES cells significantly suppressed the translational level of endoglin. This study showed that characterized hsa-miR-5739 expression by performing expression during endothelial differentiation and demonstrate potential roles of hsa-miR-5739 in human endothelial cell differentiation.
