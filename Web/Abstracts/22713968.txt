Circulating microRNAs as novel and sensitive biomarkers of acute myocardial Infarction. Coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are the leading causes of death for both men and women. Serum cardiac-specific troponin level is now used for the &quot;early&quot; diagnosis of AMI. However, due to the &quot;delayed&quot; release of troponin, an earlier, more sensitive and specific biomarker is urgently demanded to further reduce AMI mortality. Recent studies have found that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are closely linked to myocardial injury. Due to the cell-specific physiological functions and the stability of miRNAs in plasma, serum, and urine, they are emerging as sensitive biomarkers of AMI. This review summarizes the latest insights into the identification and potential application of plasma and serum miRNAs as novel biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of AMI.
