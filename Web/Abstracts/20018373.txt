Complexity of miR-223 regulation by CEBPA in human AML. microRNA-223 (miR-223) can trigger normal granulopoiesis. miR-223 expression is regulated by two distinct CEBPA (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha) sites. Here, we report that miR-223 is largely suppressed in cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. By sequencing, we found that miR-223 suppression in AML is not caused by DNA sequence alterations, nor is it mediated by promoter hypermethylation. The analysis of the individual contribution of both CEBPA sites to miR-223 regulation identified the site upstream of the miR-223 primary transcript as the predominant regulatory element. Our results suggest that miR-223 suppression in AML is caused by impaired miR-223 upstream factors.
