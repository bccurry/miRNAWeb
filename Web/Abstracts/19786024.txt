Divergent intracellular pathways regulate interleukin-1beta-induced miR-146a and miR-146b expression and chemokine release in human alveolar epithelial cells. We have previously reported that IL-beta-induced miR-146a and miR-146b expression negatively regulates IL-8 and RANTES release in human alveolar A549 epithelial cells. To determine the intracellular pathways that regulate this response, we demonstrate IL-1beta-induced activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2, c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-1/2 and p38 mitogen activated kinase (MAP) kinase pathways. Subsequent pharmacological studies show that IL-1beta-induced miR-146a, IL-8 and RANTES production was regulated via NF-kappaB and JNK-1/2 whilst miR-146b expression was mediated via MEK-1/2 and JNK-1/2. These divergent intracellular pathways likely explain the differential expression and biological action of the miR-146 isoforms.
