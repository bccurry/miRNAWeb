Epigenetic regulation of microRNA-375 and its role in melanoma development in humans. To identify epigenetically regulated miRNAs in melanoma, we treated a stage 3 melanoma cell line WM1552C, with 5AzadC and/or 4-PBA. Several hypermethylated miRNAs were detected, one of which, miR-375, was highly methylated and was studied further. Minimal CpG island methylation was observed in melanocytes, keratinocytes, normal skin, and nevus but hypermethylation was observed in patient tissue samples from primary, regional, distant, and nodular metastatic melanoma. Ectopic expression of miR-375 inhibited melanoma cell proliferation, invasion, and cell motility, and induced cell shape changes, strongly suggesting that miR-375 may have an important function in the development and progression of human melanomas.
