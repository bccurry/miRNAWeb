Stage, grade and behavior of bladder urothelial carcinoma defined by the microRNA expression profile. We identified miRNA expression profiles in urothelial carcinoma that are associated with grade, stage, and recurrence-free and disease specific survival. The expression of 14 miRNAs was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in surgical specimens from 30 patients with low grade, noninvasive (pTa) and 30 with high grade, invasive (pT2-3) urothelial carcinoma. Controls were normal bladder tissue from 5 patients who underwent surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Endogenous controls were RNU-43 and RNU-48. miRNA profiles were compared and Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to analyze disease-free and disease specific survival. miR-100 was under expressed in 100% of low grade pTa specimens (p &lt;0.001) and miR-10a was over expressed in 73.3% (p &lt;0.001). miR-21 and miR-205 were over expressed in high grade pT2-3 disease (p = 0.02 and &lt;0.001, respectively). The other miRNAs were present at levels similar to those of normal bladder tissue or under expressed in each tumor group. miR-21 over expression (greater than 1.08) was related to shorter disease-free survival in patients with low grade pTa urothelial carcinoma. Higher miR-10a levels (greater than 2.30) were associated with shorter disease-free and disease specific survival in patients with high grade pT2-3 urothelial carcinoma. Four miRNAs were differentially expressed in the 2 urothelial carcinoma groups. miR-100 and miR-10a showed under expression and over expression, respectively, in low grade pTa tumors. miR-21 and miR-205 were over expressed in pT2-3 disease. In addition, miR-10a and miR-21 over expression was associated with shorter disease-free and disease specific survival. miRNAs could be incorporated into the urothelial carcinoma molecular pathway. These miRNAs could also serve as new diagnostic or prognostic markers and new target drugs.
