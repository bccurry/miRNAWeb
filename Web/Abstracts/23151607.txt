Efficient synthesis of RITA and its analogues: derivation of analogues with improved antiproliferative activity via modulation of p53/miR-34a pathway. A novel approach to synthesize RITA by practical palladium-catalyzed C-C bond-forming Suzuki reactions at room temperature was developed, which was used for deriving a series of substituted tricyclic -heteroaryl (furan/thiophene) analogues of RITA under mild conditions. These novel analogues showed notable antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines with wild-type p53 (i.e., HCT116, A549, MCF-7 and K562), but much less activity in HCT116/p53(-/-) cells. In particular, compound 1f demonstrated promising antiproliferative activity compared to RITA, with IC(50) = 28 nM in MCF-7 vs. 54 nM for RITA, and cancer cell selectivity. Compound 1f markedly activated p53 in HCT116 cells at 100 nM, triggering apoptosis. Importantly, we found that both RITA and compound 1f induced G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest by up-regulating miR-34a, which in turn down-regulated the expression of cell cycle-related proteins CDK4 and E2F1. In summary, this study reports an effective synthetic approach for RITA and its analogues, and elucidates a novel antiproliferative mechanism of these compounds.
