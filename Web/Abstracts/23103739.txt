MiR-34a is involved in Tat-induced HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation through the SIRT1/NFB pathway. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and may contribute to HIV-1 infection. In this study, our goal was to investigate the mechanisms by which miR-34a influenced Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation through the SIRT1/NFB pathway. We showed that Tat induced up-regulation of miR-34a expression in TZM-bl cells. MiR-34a significantly inhibited SIRT1 expression. Overexpression of miR-34a increased Tat-induced LTR transactivation. Forced expression of miR-34a decreased SIRT1 protein expression and consequently diminished Tat-induced acetylation of p65, while treatment with a miR-34a inhibitor had the opposite effect. These results suggest that regulating SIRT1 by down-regulation of miR-34a levels may be a therapeutic strategy against HIV-1 replication.
