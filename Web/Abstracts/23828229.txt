microRNA-1 Induces Growth Arrest and Apoptosis in Malignant Mesothelioma. We investigated microRNA expression profiles of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) specimens to identify novel microRNA that are potentially involved in the oncogenic transformation of human pleural cells. microRNA microarray transcriptional profiling studies of 25 MPM primary tumors were performed. We used normal pleural from an unmatched patient cohort as normal comparators. To confirm microarray data, we used real-time quantitative PCR. Representative cell lines H513 and H2052 were used in functional analyses of microRNA-1. In addition to several novel MPM-associated microRNAs, we observed that the expression level of microRNA-1 was significantly lower in tumors as compared to normal pleural specimens. Subsequently, pre-mir of microRNA-1 was introduced into MPM cell lines to overexpress this microRNA. Phenotypic changes of these altered cells were assayed. The cellular proliferation rate was significantly inhibited after overexpression of microRNA-1. Early and late apoptosis was increased markedly in microRNA-1-transfected cell lines. Taken together, these data suggested that overexpression of microRNA-1 induced apoptosis in these MPM cell lines, acting as a tumor suppressor. We confirmed our observations by assessing in the transduced MPM cells cell cycle-related genes, pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes, which all showed coordinated, significant changes characteristic of the apoptotic phenotype. Thus, further investigation and validation of our microRNA database of MPM may elucidate previously unrecognized molecular pathways and/ or mechanisms by identifying novel microRNAs that are involved in malignant transformation. Our study has now found microRNA-1 to be one of these MPM-associated microRNAs, with potential pathogenic and therapeutic significance.
