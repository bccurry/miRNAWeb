[Detection, verification and significance of differentially expressed miRNAs in bladder urothelial carcinoma]. To explore the differentially expressed miRNAs in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC) in order to provide rationales for further studies of function and mechanism for their actions. Fresh normal (5 samples) and BUC (30 samples) tissues were collected from September 2008 to September 2009 in our hospital and analyzed by miRNA microarray to find differentially expressed miRNAs; RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) of recollected samples and 4 types of cell strain to verify the selected miRNAs. In grade I, grade II, grade III, grade I + II + III, infiltrating and non-infiltrating groups, hsa-miR-29b-1 was up-regulated while hsa-miR-923 and hsa-miR-300 were down-regulated. When the infiltrating BUC group was compared with the non-infiltrating BUC group, there were 7 differentially expressed miRNAs. In collected samples, the result of RT-PCR was consistent with that of miRNA array. In 4 types of cancer cell strains, only the result of T24 was completely consistent with that of miRNA array. There are differentially expressed miRNAs between normal bladder mucosa and BUC, infiltration BUC and non-infiltration BUC. The result of T24 cell strain is completely consistent with that of miRNA array.
