MiR-29a modulates the angiogenic properties of human endothelial cells. Although extensive investigation has been made on miR-29a in relation to malignancies, only a little information has been provided about the angiogenic property of this miRNA so far. Herein, we sought to investigate the role of miR-29a in regulating cell cycle and angiogenic phenotype of endothelial cells. The results showed that miR-29a is highly expressed and upregulated by hypoxia-mimicking reagents in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Consistent with this preliminary finding, introduction of exogenous agomiR-29a, or Antagomir-29a altered cell cycle progression and promoted, or repressed the proliferation and tube formation of HUVEC, respectively. Furthermore, by using luciferase reporter assay, the expression of HBP1, a suppressor transcription factor was directly regulated by miR-29a through 3'-UTR. Increased or decreased HBP1 protein level was associated with the inhibition or overexpression of miR-29a, respectively. We conclude that miR-29a has a significant role in regulating cell cycle, proliferation and angiogenic properties of HUVEC, and this function is likely mediated through HBP1 protein at the post-transcriptional level. As a novel molecular target, miR-29a may have a potential value for the treatment of angiogenesis-associated diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers.
