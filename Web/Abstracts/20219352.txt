The use of hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-181b and hsa-miR-106a as prognostic indicators of astrocytoma. The aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with a variety of diseases including cancers. In the present study, the miRNA expression profile was examined in astrocytoma, a malignant and prevalent intracranial tumour in adults. We screened the expression profile of 200 miRNAs in a training sample set consisting of 84 astrocytoma samples and 20 normal adjacent tissue (NAT) samples using the method of stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR. The significantly altered miRNAs were validated in another independent sample set consisting of 40 astrocytoma samples and 40 NAT samples. The correlation of the miRNA levels with survival in astrocytoma samples was estimated by performing Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate/multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. After a two-phase selection and validation process, seven miRNAs were found to have a significantly different expression profile in astrocytoma samples upon comparison to the NAT samples. Unsupervised clustering analysis further revealed the great potential of the 7-miRNA profile to differentiate between tumours and normal brain tissues. The down-regulation of hsa-miR-137 in astrocytomas was shown to be associated with advanced clinical stages of this disease. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis we showed that low expression of hsa-miR-181b or hsa-miR-106a, or high expression of hsa-miR-21 was significantly associated with poor patient survival. Moreover, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that this prognostic impact was independent of other clinicopathological factors. Our results suggest a great potential for the use of miRNA profiling as a powerful diagnostic and prognostic marker in defining the signature of astrocytomas and in predicting the post-surgical outcome.
