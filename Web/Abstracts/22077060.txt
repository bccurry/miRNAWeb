MicroRNA regulation of STAT4 protein expression: rapid and sensitive modulation of IL-12 signaling in human natural killer cells. IL-12 exerts several regulatory effects on natural killer (NK) cells by activating IL-12 signaling. IL-12 signaling is tightly auto-regulated to control its onset and termination, with prolonged IL-12 treatment resulting in IL-12 hyporesponsiveness. However, the mechanisms underlying IL-12 auto-regulation are still unclear. In this study we report that prolonged IL-12 treatment significantly up-regulates microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-132, -212, and -200a in primary human NK cells. This up-regulation correlates temporally with gradually decreasing STAT4 levels and decreasing IFN- expression, after an initial increase within the first 16 hours of IL-12 treatment. The IL-12 hyporesponsiveness is dependent on IL-12 concentration, and associated up-regulation of miR-132, -212, and -200a. Furthermore, IL-12-hyporesponsive cells regain responsiveness of IFN- production 24 hours after IL-12 removal, which correlates with decreases in miR-132, -212, and -200a levels. Overexpression of miR-132, -212, and -200a by transfection into NK cells mimics IL-12 priming, inducing IL-12 hyporesponsiveness, whereas transfection of miR-132, -212, and -200a inhibitors largely abolishes IL-12 induction of IL-12 hyporesponsiveness. These data suggest that miR-132, -212, and -200a up-regulation during prolonged IL-12 treatment, negatively regulates the IL-12 signaling pathway by reducing STAT4 expression in primary human NK cells.
