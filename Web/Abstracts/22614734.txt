Lentiviral expression of anti-microRNAs targeting miR-27a inhibits proliferation and invasiveness of U87 glioma cells. Glioma is a highly fatal malignant disease and its treatment options are limited. microRNAs represent a novel target for the treatment of cancer. In the present study, we used a lentiviral vector to stably express anti-microRNAs targeting the oncogenic miR-27a in U87 glioma cells. The stable expression of anti-miR-27a significantly reduced the proliferation and increased the accumulation of U87 cells in the sub-G1 phase as determined by Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays and flow cytometry, respectively. Results from the Matrigel transwell assay also indicated that the inhibition of miR-27a substantially impaired the invasiveness of U87 cells. By combining bioinformatic and proteomic approaches, we identified the mRNAs of 8 proteins upregulated in anti-miR-27a-expressing U87 cells as putative direct targets of miR-27a. Collectively, these data suggest that the lentiviral expression of anti-miR-27a is a feasible approach for the suppression of malignant phenotypes of glioma cells.
