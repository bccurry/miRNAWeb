[Methylation profile of group of miRNA genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma; involvement in cancer progression]. MicroRNA regulates gene expression, is involved in many cellular processes, and plays an important role in the development of cancer. The regulation of the expression of miRNA genes can be achieved by methylating their CpG islands, which is shown in different types of tumors. The methylation of miRNA genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) has mainly been studied for the miR-9 and miR-34 families. The methylation of six miRNA genes (miR-124a-2, -124a-3, -9-1, -9-3, -34b/c, -129-2) was investigated with the use of representative set of CCRCC samples (46 cases). Methylation of three genes miR-124a-2, -124a-3, and -129-2 was studied in kidney tumors for the first time. Methylation analysis was performed using methyl specific PCR. It is shown that the frequency of methylation of six genes (miR-124a-2, -124a-3, -9-1, -9-3, -34b/c and -129-2) was significantly higher in tumor samples than in samples of histologically normal tissue (P &lt; 3 x 10(-5) by Fisher's exact test). These results suggest the properties of tumor suppressors for the six miRNA genes indicated in CCRCC. We also found correlations between the methylation frequency of some miRNA genes and signs of the progression of CCRCC (tumor size, clinical stage, loss of differentiation, and metastasis).
