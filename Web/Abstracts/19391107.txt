Mechanism of growth inhibition by MicroRNA 145: the role of the IGF-I receptor signaling pathway. MicroRNA 145 (miR145) has been proposed as a tumor suppressor. It was previously shown that miR145 targets the 3' UTR of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and dramatically inhibits the growth of colon cancer cells. miR145 also targets the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR). We show here that an IRS-1 lacking its 3' UTR is no longer down-regulated by miR145 and rescues colon cancer cells from miR145-induced inhibition of growth. An IGF-IR resistant to miR145 (again by elimination of its 3' UTR) is not down-regulated by miR145 but fails to rescue colon cancer cells from growth inhibition. These and other results, taken together, indicate that down-regulation of IRS-1 plays a significant role in the tumor suppressor activity of miR145.
