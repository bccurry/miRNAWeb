Expression of microRNA-30c and its target genes in human osteoblastic cells by nano-bioglass ceramic-treatment. Osteoblast differentiation is tightly regulated by post transcriptional regulators such as microRNAs (miRNAs). Several bioactive materials including nano-bioglass ceramic particles (nBGC) influence differentiation of the osteoblasts, but the molecular mechanisms of nBGC-stimulation of osteoblast differentiation via miRNAs are not yet determined. In this study, we identified that nBGC-treatment stimulated miR-30c expression in human osteoblastic cells (MG63). The bioinformatics tools identified its regulatory network, molecular function, biological processes and its target genes involved in negative regulation of osteoblast differentiation. TGIF2 and HDAC4 were found to be its putative target genes and their expression was down regulated by nBGC-treatment in MG63 cells. Thus, this study advances our understanding of nBGC action on bone cells and supports utilization of nBGC in bone tissue engineering.
