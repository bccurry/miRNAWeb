The microRNA-433 inhibits liver cancer cell migration by repressing the protein expression and function of cAMP response element binding protein. We show for the first time that potent inhibition by miR-433 of expression of cAMP response element binding (CREB1) protein represses HCC cell migration.We identified a miR-433 seed match region in human and mouse CREB1 3UTRs. Overexpression of miR-433 markedly decreased hCREB1 3UTR reporter activity, and the inhibitory effect of miR-433 was alleviated upon mutation of its binding site. Ectopic expression of miR-433 reduced CREB1 protein levels in a variety of human and mouse cancer cells, including Hela, Hepa1, Huh7, and HepG2. hCREB1 protein levels in highly invasive MHCC97H cells were diminished by expression of miR-433 but induced by miR-433 antigomir. The expression of mCREB1 protein negatively correlated with miR-433 levels in nuclear receptor SHP-/- liver tissues and liver tumors as compared to the wild-type mice. miR-433 exhibited a significant repression of MHCC97H cell migration, which was reversed by anti-miR-433. Overexpressing miR-433 inhibited foci formation dramatically, demonstrating that miR-433 may exert a tumor suppressor function. Knockdown of CREB1 by siRNAs impeded MHCC97H cell migration and invasion and antagonized the effect of anti-miR-433. Interestingly, siCREB1 decreased MHCC97H cell proliferation, which was not influenced by anti-miR-433. Overexpressing CREB1 dampened the inhibitory activity of miR-433. The CpG islands surrounding miR-433 were hypermethylated and the DNA methylation agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, but not histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, drastically stimulated the expression of miR- 433 and miR-127 in HCC cells. The latter is clustered with miR-433. The results revealed a critical role of miR-433 in mediating HCC cell migration via CREB1.
