Regulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator by microRNA-145, -223, and -494 is altered in F508 cystic fibrosis airway epithelium. Expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is altered in individuals with the F508 CFTR mutation. We previously reported differential expression of microRNA (miRNA) in CF airway epithelium; however, the role of miRNA in regulation of CFTR expression here remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of upregulated miRNAs in CFTR regulation in vivo in bronchial brushings from individuals homozygous or heterozygous for F508 CFTR, validated our observations in vitro, and assessed the impact of defective chloride ion conductance, genotype, and colonization status on miRNA expression. miRNA target prediction was performed in silico, and expression of miRNA and target genes were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and/or Western blotting. Overexpression and inhibition studies were performed with pre-miRs or antimiRs, respectively, and a luciferase reporter gene was used to elucidate direct miRNA-target interactions. miR-145, miR-223, and miR-494 were upregulated in CF versus non-CF bronchial brushings and cell lines; in F508 CFTR homozygotes versus heterozygotes; in subjects positive for P. aeruginosa; and in cells treated with a CFTR inhibitor or IL-1. Reciprocal downregulation or upregulation of CFTR gene and/or protein expression was observed after miRNA manipulation and direct miRNA-target relationships demonstrated via a reporter system containing a wild type or mutated full-length CFTR 3' untranslated region. Increased expression of miR-145, miR-223, and miR-494 in vivo in bronchial epithelium of individuals carrying the F508 CFTR mutation correlates with decreased CFTR expression. Defective CFTR function, Pseudomonas colonization, and inflammation may affect miRNA expression and contribute to the regulation of F508 CFTR.
