Down-regulation of some miRNAs by degrading their precursors contributes to anti-cancer effect of mistletoe lectin-I. Mistletoe lectin-I (ML-I), the main anti-cancer component of mistletoe extracts, was originally thought to act exclusively on 28S rRNA. Here, we investigate the down-regulating effect and mechanism of CM-1, an ML-I isolated from Chinese mistletoe, on some miRNAs. The anti-cancer effects of CM-1 were assessed in vitro and in vivo in colorectal cancer cells. The miRNAs down-regulated by CM-1 were identified by miRNA microarray assay and validated by qRT-PCR analysis. The suppression of host gene transcription or by degradation of precursors was determined by qRT-PCR and enzyme activity assays respectively. The qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to examine the expression of their target gene and related downstream effector. Cell proliferation was assayed in stably transfected HEK-293 cells with different levels of these miRNAs. CM-1 showed prominent anti-neoplastic activity towards CLY and HT-29 cells both in vitro and in vivo. The miR-135a&amp;b were the miRNAs most down-regulated by CM-1. Their host gene transcription was largely up-regulated, while their precursors were degraded directly by CM-1. The expression of their target gene adenomatous polyposis coli and the phosphorylation of related effector -catenin were both significantly up-regulated. The IC(50) values of CM-1 on derivative HEK-293 cells with high miR-135a&amp;b levels were 2-4 times lower than that of control cells. CM-1 down-regulated some miRNAs by degrading their precursors, which contributes to its prominent anti-cancer activity.
