Differential expression of cellular microRNAs in HPV-11 transfected cells. An analysis by three different array platforms and qRT-PCR. Human papillomavirus type 11 (HPV-11) infects the genital and the respiratory tract leading to condylomas and respiratory papillomatosis. HPV infections are restricted to epithelial tissue and the progression through the virus lifecycle is tightly coordinated to the differentiation of the host cell. The changes of cellular microRNAs by HPV-11 gene expression were investigated in a cell culture model of HaCaT cells transfected with HPV-11, with the goal of understanding which cellular processes were affected by the virus. Human microRNA profiling was conducted on three different array platform systems and because very few microRNAs (miR-663, -638, -149* and -92b*) were consistently found in all three array data sets we performed extensive statistical analyses of the array data and the qRT-PCR validation. We assume that the most reliable differentially expressed microRNAs are the ones identified by more than one array platform. We also show that TaqMan qRT-PCR validation is of limited use for less abundant microRNAs.
