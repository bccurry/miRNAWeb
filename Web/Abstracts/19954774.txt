microRNA-342, microRNA-191 and microRNA-510 are differentially expressed in T regulatory cells of type 1 diabetic patients. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical regulators of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is hypothesised that Tregs' function can be influenced by changes in the expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs). Thus, we performed miRNAs profiling in a population of Tregs separated from peripheral blood of five type 1 diabetic patients and six healthy donors. For more detailed molecular characterisation of Tregs, we additionally compared miRNAs expression profiles of Tregs and conventional T cells. Tregs were isolated according to CD3+, CD4+, CD25(hi)+ and CD127- by flow cytometry, and miRNA expression profiling was performed using TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA Panel-1 (384-well low density array). In Tregs of diabetic patients we found significantly increased expression of miRNA-510 (p=0.05) and decreased expression of both miRNA-342 (p&lt;0.0001) and miRNA-191 (p=0.0079). When comparing Tregs and T cells, we revealed that Tregs had significant higher expression of miRNA-146a and lower expression of eight specific miRNAs (20b, 31, 99a, 100, 125b, 151, 335, and 365). To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating changes in miRNA expression profiles occurring in Tregs of T1D patients and a miRNAs signature of adult Tregs.
