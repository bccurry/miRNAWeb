Regulation of miRNA expression by Src and contact normalization: effects on nonanchored cell growth and migration. Transformation by the Src tyrosine kinase (Src) promotes nonanchored cell growth and migration. However, nontransformed cells can force Src-transformed cells to assume a normal morphology and phenotype by a process called 'contact normalization'. It has become clear that microRNA (miRNA) can affect tumorigenesis by targeting gene products that direct cell growth and migration. However, the roles of miRNA in Src transformation or contact normalization have not yet been reported. We examined the expression of 95 miRNAs and found 9 of them significantly affected by Src. In this study, we report that miR-218 and miR-224 were most significantly induced by Src, but not affected by contact normalization. In contrast, miR-126 was most significantly suppressed by Src and was induced by contact normalization in transformed cells. Mir-126 targets Crk, a component of the focal adhesion network that participates in events required for tumor cell migration. Accordingly, we show that miR-126 expression correlates inversely with Crk levels, motility and the invasive potential of human mammary carcinoma cells. Moreover, we show that miR-224 expression promotes nonanchored growth of nontransformed cells. These data reveal novel insights into how Src regulates miRNA expression to promote hallmarks of tumor cell growth and invasion, and how nontransformed cells can affect miRNA expression in adjacent tumor cells to inhibit this process.
