Inhibition of miRNA-221 suppresses the airway inflammation in asthma. This study investigated the expression of miRNA-221 in asthmatics in order to determine whether miRNA-221 plays a role in the development of asthma. Real-time PCR was used to detect the miRNA-221 in both asthmatic and control subjects. In addition, airway inflammation was evaluated by cell counting and tissue biopsy in the OVA-induced murine asthma model. miRNA-221 was differentially expressed in asthmatics and control subjects, and miRNA-221 blockade resulted in a reduction of airway inflammation in the OVA-induced murine asthma model. We conclude that miRNA-221 participates in the pathogenesis of asthma and that inhibition of miRNA-221 suppresses airway inflammation in asthmatics.
