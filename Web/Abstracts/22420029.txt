Aberrant expression of miR-196a in gastric cancers and correlation with recurrence. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs (~22 nt) that play important roles in the pathogenesis of human diseases by negatively regulating gene expression. Here, we examined the relationship between miR-196a and gastric cancer.By the analysis of 72 gastric cancer samples, we found that the expression level of miR-196a microRNA significantly increased in primary gastric cancer tissues versus adjacent normal tissues. In addition, extracellular miR-196a detected in conditioned medium was strongly correlated with its cellular expression status and increased circulating miR-196a in patient serum was associated with gastric cancer disease status and relapse. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-196a microRNA promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and migration/invasion capabilities of transfected cells, suggesting its oncogenic potential in gastric cancer progression. Altogether, our data demonstrate that miR-196a exerts an oncogenic role in gastric cancer and miR-196a may be a novel biomarker for detecting gastric cancer and for monitoring disease recurrence.
