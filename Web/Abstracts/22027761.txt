1,3,4-tri-O-galloyl-6-O-caffeoyl--D-glucopyranose, a new anti-proliferative ellagitannin, regulates the expression of microRNAs in HepG(2) cancer cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. 1, 3, 4-tri-O-galloyl-6-O-caffeoyl--D-glucopyranose (BJA32515) is a new natural ellagitannin compound extracted from Balanophora Japonica MAKINO. The effect of BJA32515 on the expression of miRNAs in cancer cells has not yet been explored. Objective The present study was carried out to examine the changes in miRNA expression profiles in human HepG(2) hepatocarcinoma cells following BJA32515 exposure. The proliferation of BJA32515-exposed HepG(2) cells was assessed using a colorimetric assay (cell counting kit-8). The miRNA expression profile of the cancer cells was analyzed using a miRNA array and quantitative real-time PCR. Apoptosis was assessed by annexin V and propidium iodide staining. BJA32515 inhibited the cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in HepG(2) cancer cells. The exposure to BJA32515 also caused alterations in the miRNA expression profile in the cells, with 33 miRNAs upregulated and 59 down-regulated. The up-regulation of let-7a and miR-29a and the down-regulation of miR-373 and miR-197 were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. CONCLSION: BJA32515-modifed miRNA expression may mediate the antiproliferative effect of this compound in HepG(2) cancer cells.
