miR-342 is associated with estrogen receptor- expression and response to tamoxifen in breast cancer. Estrogen receptor- (ER) is essential for estrogen-dependent growth and its level of expression is a crucial determinant of response to endocrine therapy and prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer. Breast cancer patients show a wide range of ER expression levels which change in individual patients during disease progression and in response to systemic therapies. However, little is known concerning how the expression of ER is regulated in human breast cancer. Recently, several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to regulate ER expression and to predict ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) status. The expression levels of miR-342 and ER mRNA were analyzed in human breast cancer samples and cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis. The correlations between the expression levels of miR-342 and clinicopathological factors were analyzed. Statistically significant associations were observed between miR-342 and ER, HER2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) status in the human breast cancer samples and the levels of miR-342 gradually increased as ER mRNA expression increased. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of miR-342 upregulated the expression levels of the ER mRNA and significantly sensitized the MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cellular proliferation. These results suggested that miR-342 expression is positively correlated with ER mRNA expression in human breast cancer and that it may be a significant marker for predicting tamoxifen sensitivity in ER-positive breast cancer and a potential target for restoring ER expression and responding to antiestrogen therapy.
