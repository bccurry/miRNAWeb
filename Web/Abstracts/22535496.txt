Association of MicroRNA-146a with Autoimmune Diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of approximately 20-22-nucleotide-long non-coding RNAs that repress target gene expression through mRNA degradation and translation inhibition. MiRNA (miR)-146a, located in the second exon of the LOC285628 gene on human chromosome 5, is a negative regulator in immune and inflammatory responses. Studies have indicated that miR-146a is associated with the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjgren's syndrome. In this review, emphasis will be laid on the recent progress in the functional roles of miR-146a in these autoimmune diseases.
