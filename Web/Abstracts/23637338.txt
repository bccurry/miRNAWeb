miR-200 and miR-96 families repress neural induction from human embryonic stem cells. The role of miRNAs in neuroectoderm specification is largely unknown. We screened miRNA profiles that are differentially changed when human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were differentiated to neuroectodermal precursors (NEP), but not to epidermal (EPI) cells and found that two miRNA families, miR-200 and miR-96, were uniquely downregulated in the NEP cells. We confirmed zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox (ZEB) transcription factors as a target of the miR-200 family members and identified paired box 6 (PAX6) transcription factor as the new target of miR-96 family members via gain- and loss-of-function analyses. Given the essential roles of ZEBs and PAX6 in neural induction, we propose a model by which miR-200 and miR-96 families coordinate to regulate neural induction.
