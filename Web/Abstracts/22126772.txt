[MicroRNA-221 promotes colon carcinoma cell proliferation in vitro by inhibiting CDKN1C/p57 expression]. To investigate the regulatory effect of microRNA-221 (MIR221) on CDKN1C/p57 expression in colon carcinoma cells in vitro. Caco2 cells were treated with or without anti-p57-siRNA prior to the addition of pre-MIR221 or anti-MIR221. The MIR221 expression pattern was detected by real-time RT-PCR, and the mRNA and protein levels of CDKN1C/p57 expression were detected using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. Caco2 cell proliferation following the treatment was detected with MTT assay. CDKN1C/p57 3'-UTR fragment was amplified by PCR from the genome DNA of human colon and inserted into a luciferase reporter plasmid. The luciferase reporter plasmid construct was then transfected into Caco2 cells along with pre-MIR221 or anti-MIR221, and the luciferase activity in the transfected cells was detected. MIR221-specific inhibitor significantly up-regulated CDKN1C/p57 protein expression in Caco2 cells (P&lt;0.01). Anti-MIR221 could markedly inhibit Caco2 cell proliferation, and the inhibitory effect was obviously abolished by pretreatment with anti-p57-siRNA, suggesting that the inhibition was mediated by CDKN1C/p57 (P&lt;0.01). A significant increase of luciferase activity was detected in Caco2 cells co-transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid construct and anti-MIR221 (P&lt;0.01). MIR221 can interact with the target site on the 3'-UTR of CDKN1C/p57 mRNA to inhibit CDKN1C/p57 expression by post-transcriptional gene silencing to promote colon carcinoma cell proliferation, suggesting the value of MIR221 as a potential target for treatment of colon carcinoma.
