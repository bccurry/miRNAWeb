MicroRNA expression signature in atrial fibrillation with mitral stenosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the microRNA (miRNA) signature in atrial fibrillation (AF) with mitral stenosis (MS). miRNA arrays were used to evaluate the expression signature of the right atrial appendages of healthy individuals (n=9), patients with MS and AF (n=9) and patients with MS without AF (n=4). The results were validated with qRT-PCR analysis. GOmir was used to predict the potential miRNA targets and to analyze their functions. DIANA-mirPath was used to incorporate the miRNAs into pathways. miRNA arrays revealed that 136 and 96 miRNAs were expressed at different levels in MS patients with AF and in MS patients without AF, respectively, compared with healthy controls. More importantly, 28 miRNAs were expressed differently in the MS patients with AF compared with the MS patients without AF; of these miRNAs, miR-1202 was the most dysregulated. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on the 28 differently expressed miRNAs showed that the heat map of miRNA expression categorized two well-defined clusters that corresponded to MS with AF and MS without AF. The qRT-PCR results correlated well with the microarray data. Bioinformatic analysis indicated the potential miRNA targets and molecular pathways. This study shows that there is a distinct miRNA expression signature in AF with MS. The findings may be useful for the development of therapeutic interventions that are based on rational target selection in these patients.
