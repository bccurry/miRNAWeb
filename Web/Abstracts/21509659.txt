The miRNA expression profile of the uveal melanoma. The miRNA expression profile was initially established to investigate its corresponding function in human uveal melanoma. The miRNA expression profile in human uveal melanoma was analyzed by a micro chip technique. The hsa-miRNA expression between four uveal melanomas and four normal uveal tissues was compared. Based on the bioinformatic approach, chip data was analyzed to select out differentially expressed candidate hsa-miRNAs. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) was used to confirm the candidate hsa-miRNAs expression in all samples. The results of miRNA microarray chips that matched with RT-PCR were considered as the miRNA expression which was significantly different between normal tissue and uveal melanomas. In four uveal melanomas, expressions of miRNA-20a, miRNA-106a, miRNA-17, miRNA-21, and miRNA-34a were significantly up-regulated, while miRNA-145 and miRNA-204 expression were significantly down-regulated. We used miRNA microarray analysis as a fast, efficient technology to study biological information. The differentially expressed miRNAs may be involved in uveal melanoma pathogenesis, and may help promote the diagnosis and treatment for uveal melanoma.
