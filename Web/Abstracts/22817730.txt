Pleiotropy of microRNA-192 in the kidney. Diverse aetiologies result in significant deviation from homoeostasis in the kidney, leading to CKD (chronic kidney disease). CKD progresses to end-stage renal disease principally as a result of renal fibrosis, although the molecular mechanisms underlying this fibrotic process are still poorly understood. miRNAs (microRNAs) are a recently discovered family of endogenous short single-stranded RNAs that regulate global gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The recent findings from our laboratory and others discussed in the present review outline pleiotropic roles for miR-192 in renal homoeostasis and in the fibrotic kidney. We describe miR-192-driven anti-and pro-fibrotic effects via the repression of ZEB1 and ZEB2 (zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox proteins 1 and 2), resulting in changes in extracellular matrix deposition and cell differentiation.
