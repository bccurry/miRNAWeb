Permissive role of miR-663 in induction of VEGF and activation of the ATF4 branch of unfolded protein response in endothelial cells by oxidized phospholipids. Atherosclerotic lesions contain high concentrations of oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) known to induce VEGF via the ATF4 arm of unfolded protein response (UPR), and to promote angiogenic reactions thus potentially contributing to the progression and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. In order to get further insights into the mechanisms of cellular stress-induced angiogenesis we studied the role of a specific microRNA (miR-663) in the mechanisms of VEGF induction by OxPLs and inducers of UPR. miRNA and mRNA levels were determined using microarray profiling and qRT-PCR methods. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. miR-663 levels were changed by transfecting cells with synthetic oligonucleotides. OxPAPC elevated miR-663 in two types of human endothelial cells (ECs). Knockdown of miR-663 inhibited upregulation of VEGF mRNA in ECs treated by OxPAPC, OxPAPS or OxPAPA. In addition, silencing of miR-663 suppressed upregulation by OxPAPC of ATF4 mRNA and protein, as well as a downstream gene TRIB. Similarly to the inhibition of OxPAPC effects, knockdown of miR-663 suppressed elevation of ATF4, VEGF and TRIB in response to another inducer of UPR, tunicamycin. Overexpression of miR-663 reversed the inhibition of VEGF induction by miR-663 inhibitor. miR-663 is critically important for 2 key events induced in ECs by stress agents and oxidized lipids, namely induction of transcription factor ATF4 and its downstream gene VEGF. These findings allow hypothesizing that miR-663 plays a general role in control of the ATF4 branch of UPR induced by different agents.
