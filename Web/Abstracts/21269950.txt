[Differential expression of hsa-miR-126 and hsa-miR-518b in esophageal squamous carcinoma]. To identify the differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) between esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESC) and adjacent non-tumorous tissue (NT). The expression levels of the miRNAs were detected in 3 fresh ESC and NT samples by hybridization with miRNAs microarray chip. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed to confirm the results of the microarray analysis. The expressions of hsa-miR-126 and hsa-miR-518b in ESC were validated by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in another independent 15 matched samples. A total of 11 miRNAs exhibited differential expressions in ESC samples as compared to their expressions in the NT samples, including a 1 up-regulated miRNA and 10 down-regulated miRNAs. Compared with normal esophageal samples, the ESC tissues showed up-regulated hsa-miR-126 and down-regulated hsa-miR-518b expression. hsa-miR-126 and hsa-miR-518b are differentially expressed in ESC, and they might play important roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of ESC.
