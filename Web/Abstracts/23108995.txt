MiR-26a regulates cell cycle and anoikis of human esophageal adenocarcinoma cells through Rb1-E2F1 signaling pathway. Resistance to anoikis, the subtype of apoptosis induced by lack of matrix adhesion, contributes to malignant transformation and development of metastasis. MicroRNAs play key regulatory roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. In this study, we described that miR-26a, which is usually downregulated in tumor cells, is involved in the acquisition of anoikis-resistance of human esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) cells. Results of qRT-PCR in clinical samples showed that downregulated miR-26a expression is related to tumorigenesis and metastasis of EA. In vitro experiments determined that miR-26a directly participates in the regulation of cell cycle and anoikis of human EA OE33 cells. Further, we identified that Rb1 is the direct functional target of miR-26a, and revealed that the reduction of miR-26a expression leads to increased Rb1 protein level and thus inhibits the function of E2F1, by which it influences the phenotypes of cell cycle and anoikis. The findings we reported here presented the evidence that miR-26a may be involved in regulation of anoikis-resistance of EA cells. Targeting miR-26a may provide a novel strategy to inhibit metastasis.
