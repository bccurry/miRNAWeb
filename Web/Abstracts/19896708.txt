miR-138 might reverse multidrug resistance of leukemia cells. Here we firstly investigated the role of miR-138 in multidrug resistance of leukemia cells. miR-138 was found up-regulated in the vincristine-induced multidrug resistance (MDR) leukemia cell line HL-60/VCR as compared with HL-60 cells. Up-regulation of miR-138 could reverse resistance of both P-glycoprotein-related and P-glycoprotein-non-related drugs on HL-60/VCR cells, and promote adriamycin-induced apoptosis, accompanied by increased accumulation and decreased releasing amount of adriamycin. miR-138 could significantly down-regulate the expression of P-glycoprotein, Bcl-2, and the transcription of the multidrug resistance gene 1. Further study of the biological functions of miR-138 might be helpful for developing possible strategies to treat leukemia.
