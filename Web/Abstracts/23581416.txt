Expression and prognostic significance of hsa-miR-142-3p in acute leukemias. The microRNA 142 (miR-142) is expressed at high levels in mature hematopoietic cells and has a crucial role during T-lymphocyte development. Its role in leukemogenesis is unclear. Expression of miR-142 was analyzed in acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia cells (de novo, cell lines). Data were compared to expression in CD34+ hematopoietic cells. Based on the miR-142 expression, clinical data such as overall survival was analyzed. MiR-142 expression in all leukemia cell lines and 86 % of the de novo samples was higher than in CD34+ cells. This difference could be detected in both, myeloid and lymphoid neoplastic cells. In AML patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk a high miR-142 expression was associated with a better overall survival. MiR-142 expression in acute lymphoblastic as well as myeloid leukemia cells is higher than in CD34+ cells. Additionally, miR-142 expression might have prognostic relevance in AML-patients with otherwise an intermediate cytogenetic risk.
