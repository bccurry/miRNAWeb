Role of ZNRD1 (zinc ribbon domain-containing 1) in angiogenesis of leukaemia cells. Here, we have first investigated the roles of ZNRD1 in angiogenesis of leukaemia. The leukaemia cell line K562 was transfected with the vector that included the full-length cDNA of ZNRD1, then the growth and angiogenesis of cells were detected. Up-regulation of ZNRD1 could significantly inhibit the growth of cells, reduce tumour microvessel densities and inhibit the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) production. The results of human miRNA array and real-time PCR showed that ZNRD1 could significantly up-regulate the expression of miR-214 and down-regulate the expression of miR-296. Taken together, ZNRD1 might inhibit tumour angiogenesis and could be considered as a target for leukaemia therapy.
