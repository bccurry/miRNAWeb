NF-kappaB activation stimulates osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells derived from human adipose tissue by increasing TAZ expression. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a skeletal catabolic agent that stimulates osteoclastogenesis and inhibits osteoblast function. Although TNF-alpha inhibits the mineralization of osteoblasts, the effect of TNF-alpha on mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is not clear. In this study, we determined the effect of TNF-alpha on osteogenic differentiation of stromal cells derived from human adipose tissue (hADSC) and the role of NF-kappaB activation on TNF-alpha activity. TNF-alpha treatment dose-dependently increased osteogenic differentiation over the first 3 days of treatment. TNF-alpha activated ERK and increased NF-kappaB promoter activity. PDTC, an NF-kappaB inhibitor, blocked the osteogenic differentiation induced by TNF-alpha and TLR-ligands, but U102, an ERK inhibitor, did not. Overexpression of miR-146a induced the inhibition of IRAK1 expression and inhibited basal and TNF-alpha- and TLR ligand-induced osteogenic differentiation. TNF-alpha and TLR ligands increased the expression of transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), which was inhibited by the addition of PDTC. A ChIP assay showed that p65 was bound to the TAZ promoter. TNF-alpha also increased osteogenic differentiation of human gastroepiploic artery smooth muscle cells. Our data indicate that TNF-alpha enhances osteogenic differentiation of hADSC via the activation of NF-kappaB and a subsequent increase of TAZ expression.
