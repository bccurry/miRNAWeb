MicroRNAs miR-21a and miR-93 are down regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with type 1 diabetes. It is well established that type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease. Controversial data exists regarding the differential control of the immune system in T1D patients compared to unaffected individuals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the control of gene expression (by negative regulation of gene expression at post-transcriptional level, by mediating translational repression or degradation of the mRNA targets). Their potential role in T cell activation and autoimmunity is controversial. We investigated the expression profile of miR-21a and miR-93 in PMC samples of 20 T1D patients and 20 healthy controls by means of qPCR in different glucose concentrations (basal, 11 nM and 25 mM), and we analyzed the possible relationship of this expression pattern with autoimmunity. MiR-21a was significantly underexpressed in T1D samples (media values expression 0.23  0.05, p &lt; 0.01) compared to controls (values less than 1 indicate a decrease in gene expression). When the PMCs were incubated with glucose 11 mM and 25 mM, miR-21a expression decreased in controls and increased in T1D samples (0.506  0.05, p &lt; 0.04). MiR-93 was underexpressed in T1D patients (0.331  0.05, p &lt; 0.02) compared to control samples. However, when the PBMCs were incubated with glucose, no changes were observed. No association with autoimmunity was observed. We demonstrated that miRNAs have a differential expression in PBMCs from T1D patients compared to controls, suggesting that these miRNAs or others could be involved in T cell regulation.
