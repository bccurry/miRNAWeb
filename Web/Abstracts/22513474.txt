[Current progress in functions of axon guidance molecule Slit and underlying molecular mechanism]. The axon guidance molecule Slit is a secreted glucoprotein which is conserved during evolution. Slit has been implicated in regulating a variety of life activities, such as axon guidance, neuronal migration, neuronal morphological differentiation, tumor metastasis, angiogenesis and heart morphogenesis. Slit function mainly depends on the binding of its LRR-2 domain to the Ig1 domain of Roundabout (Robo) receptor, meanwhile Slit function is also mediated by a range of signaling molecules, including the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), tyrosine kinase Abelson, calcium ions, MicroRNA-218 and other axon guidance molecules. Several transcription factors, including Single-minded, Irx and Midline, were shown to regulate slit expression. In addition, multiple Slit isoforms exist as a consequence of alternative spliced transcripts. The research on guidance mechanism of Slit will facilitate the understanding of molecular mechanism underlying neural networks formation in the process of neural development and regeneration. Meanwhile, the studying of Slit guidance mechanism could promote the prevention and treatment of human neurological diseases and cancer metastasis.
