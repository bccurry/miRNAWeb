Effect of miR-34b overexpression on the radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. The miR-34 family, under-expressed in-non small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), are effectors of p53 activation upon irradiation of cells. We evaluated whether the miR-34b overexpression modulates the NSCLCs response to radiation. NSCLC cell lines A549 with V-KI-RAS2 Kirsten Rat Sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) codon 12 mutation and with wild type p53, and H1299, not expressing p53, were irradiated after transfection with pre-miR-34b. Cell survival was assessed by clonogenic survival assays. The apoptosis and the cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry. In the A549 cell line, overexpression of miR-34b significantly reduced cell survival at lower than 4 Gy radiation doses. There was a significant reduction in B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) expression but no significant differences were observed in the apoptotic cell population or the cycle profile. No significant effect was recorded in the H1299 irradiated cells. In the p53 wild type, KRAS mutated NSCLC cells, the overexpression of miR-34b increases radiosensitivity at low doses of radiation.
