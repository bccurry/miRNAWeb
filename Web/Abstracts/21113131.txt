miR-301a as an NF-B activator in pancreatic cancer cells. NF-B is constitutively activated in most human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which is a deadly malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of about 5%. In this work, we investigate whether microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to NF-B activation in pancreatic cancer. We demonstrate that miR-301a down-regulates NF-B-repressing factor (Nkrf) and elevates NF-B activation. As NF-B promotes the transcription of miR-301a, our results support a positive feedback loop as a mechanism for persistent NF-B activation, in which miR-301a represses Nkrf to elevate NF-B activity, which in turn promotes miR-301a transcription. Nkrf was found down-regulated and miR-301a up-regulated in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues. Moreover, miR-301a inhibition or Nkrf up-regulation in pancreatic cancer cells led to reduced NF-B target gene expression and attenuated xenograft tumour growth, indicating that miR-301a overexpression contributes to NF-B activation. Revealing this novel mechanism of NF-B activation by an miRNA offers new avenues for therapeutic interventions against pancreatic cancer.
