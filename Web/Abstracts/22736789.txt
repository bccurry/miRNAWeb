The oncogenic role of miR-155 in breast cancer. miR-155 is an oncogenic miRNA with well described roles in leukemia. However, additional roles of miR-155 in breast cancer progression have recently been described. A thorough literature search was conducted to review all published data to date, examining the role of miR-155 in breast cancer. Data on all validated miR-155 target genes was collated to identify biologic pathways relevant to miR-155 and breast cancer progression. Publications describing the clinical relevance, functional characterization, and regulation of expression of miR-155 in the context of breast cancer are reviewed. A total of 147 validated miR-155 target genes were identified from the literature. Pathway analysis of these genes identified likely roles in apoptosis, differentiation, angiogenesis, proliferation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The large number of validated miR-155 targets presented here provide many avenues of interest as to the clinical potential of miR-155. Further investigation of these target genes will be required to elucidate the specific mechanisms and functions of miR-155 in breast cancer. This is the first review examining the role of miR-155 in breast cancer progression. The collated data of target genes and biologic pathways of miR-155 identified in this review suggest new avenues of research for this oncogenic miRNA.
