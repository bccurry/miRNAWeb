Activity of TAR in inducible inhibition of HIV replication by foamy virus vector expressing siRNAs under the control of HIV LTR. In this report we describe foamy virus vectors with conditional expression of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in HIV infected cells. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) based on two targets in the 5' end of the untranslated region and one in the rev gene flanked with 5' and 3' microRNA 30 (miR30) sequences were synthesized and placed under the control of an HIV promoter for Tat-mediated expression. HIV permissive cells were transduced with foamy virus vectors containing each hybrid shRNA expression cassette and tested for their efficacy on the inhibition of HIV replication. Effective Tat dependent expression of the shRNAs, as well as GFP placed downstream each shRNA was evident. In addition the results show inhibition of HIV replication by greater than 98%. Interestingly, transduction of cells with a vector lacking an shRNA also revealed GFP expression in the presence of Tat with similar levels of inhibition of virus replication. When the TAR region was removed from this vector there was neither reduction in virus replication nor Tat-induced GFP expression. These results suggest that TAR in the vector, which Tat interacts to promote expression of the shRNA, is a potent inhibitor of virus replication. Previous studies with TAR regulated expression of antiviral genes ignore the contribution of TAR in the repression of virus replication. Interpretation of effective inhibition of HIV replication by antiviral genes located downstream of TAR while neglecting the efficacy of a potent repression by TAR is misleading.
