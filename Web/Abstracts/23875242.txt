The role of miR-145 in microvasculature. Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs(miRs) play a crucial role in the cardiovascular system, and recent studies have revealed a significant role of miRs in vascular biology and disease, miR-145 is one of the most-studied miRs, and especially in the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMCs) proliferation, differentiation, and phenotypic switching. In cardiovascular system, miR-145 is not only important for heart and vascular development but also plays an essential role in cardiac pathological factors, such as hypertrophy, and ischemia. However, its potential role in microvasculature has not been systematically evaluated yet. We are just beginning to understand the regulation of miR in vascular biology. In particular, the miR biogenesis and regulatory pathways in the vascular system have not yet been well characterized, This review focuses on the basic biology and mechanism of action of miR-145 specifically pertaining to microvascular development, pericyte and disease, In addition it addresses the potential for miR-145 to be used therapeutically in the treatment of microvascular disease.
