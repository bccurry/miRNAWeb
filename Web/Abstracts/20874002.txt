MiR-146b-5p suppresses EGFR expression and reduces in vitro migration and invasion of glioma. Human miR-146b-5p is located on chromosome 10q24.3. Loss of the 10q24-26 region is frequently observed in gliomas. Here, we report that miR-146b-5p suppresses expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in human glioblastoma cell lines. Introduction of miR-146b-5p decreases cell invasion, migration, and phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT). MiR-146b-5p suppresses translation of EGFR, and binds to the EGFR 3'-UTR. Furthermore, analysis of U87-MG laser-capture microdissected cells in tumor-bearing mice indicated that expression of miR-146b-5p was inversely correlated with distance from the tumor core. These findings suggest that reconstitution of miR-146b-5p may be useful for the treatment of this invasive tumor.
