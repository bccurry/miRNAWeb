MiR-138 suppresses expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma 786-O cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1a) is widely considered to be one of the key regulators in cancer cells. Here, we investigated a microRNA regulating expression of HIF-1a and explored its functions in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells. Western blot and reporter assays were used to assess HIF-1a as a direct target of miR-138. The effects of miR-138 or si-HIF-1a on ccRCC 786-O cells were also estimated by apoptosis analysis and cell migration assay. The data showed HIF-1a to be one target of miR-138. Futhermore, inhibition of the expression of HIF-1a with specific siRNA or miR-138 could increase apoptosis and reduce the migration of 786-O cells. miR-138 could inhibit the expression of HIF-1a and regulate the apoptosis and migration of ccRCC cells.
