Expression analysis of MiR-21, MiR-205, and MiR-342 in breast cancer in Iran. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules characterized by their regulatory roles in cancer and gene expression. We analyzed the expression of miR-21, miR-205, and miR-342 in 59 patients with breast cancer. Samples were divided into three different groups according to their immunohistochemistry (IHC) classification: ER-positive and/or PR-positive group (ER+ and/or PR+; group I); HER2-positive group (HER2+; group II); and ER/PR/HER2- negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-; group III) as the triple negative group. The expression levels of the 3 miRNAs were analyzed in the tumor samples and the compared with the normal neighboring dissected tumor (NNDT) samples in all three groups. The expression of miR-21 was similar in all three groups. In patients positive for P53 by IHC, positive for axillary lymph node metastasis and higher tumor stages, it appeared to have significantly elevated. However, significant increase was not found among the 18 fibroadenoma samples. Both miR-205 and miR-342 expressions were significantly down regulated in group III. We conclude that miR-21 does not discriminate between different breast cancer groups. In contrast, miR-205 and miR-342 may be used as potential biomarkers for diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer.
