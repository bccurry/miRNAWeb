miRNA 34a, 100, and 137 modulate differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in proper function and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We performed a systematic comparison of miRNA expression in undifferentiated vs. differentiating ESCs. We report that 138 miRNAs are increased on the induction of differentiation. We compared the entire list of candidate mRNA targets of up-regulated miRNAs with that of mRNA down-regulated in ESCs on induction of differentiation. Among the candidate targets emerging from this analysis, we found three genes, Smarca5, Jarid1b, and Sirt1, previously demonstrated to be involved in sustaining the undifferentiated phenotype in ESCs. On this basis, we first demonstrated that Smarca5 is a direct target of miR-100, Jarid1b of miR-137, and we also confirmed previously published data demonstrating that Sirt1 is a direct target of miR-34a in a different context. The suppression of these three miRNAs by anti-miRs caused the block of ESC differentiation induced by LIF withdrawal. On the other hand, the overexpression of the three miRNAs resulted in an altered expression of differentiation markers. These results demonstrate that miR-34a, miR-100, and miR-137 are required for proper differentiation of mouse ESCs, and that they function in part by targeting Sirt1, Smarca5, and Jarid1b mRNAs.
