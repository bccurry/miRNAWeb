Reduced circulating miR-15b is correlated with phosphate metabolism in patients with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis. Disorders of mineral metabolism can facilitate the progression of vascular calcification and are closely associated with adverse outcomes in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). miR-15b has been implicated in the epigenetic regulation of key metabolism, stress response, and osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we detected miR-15b in the plasma of 30 patients with ESRD and 20 healthy controls using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). Compared with healthy controls, the circulating levels of miR-15b were significantly reduced in patients with ESRD. However, there is no significant difference in circulating miR-15b levels when comparing prehemodialysis and posthemodialysis in patients with ESRD. In addition, to further estimate the potential roles of aberrantly expressed candidate miR-15b in the pathogenesis of ESRD, we utilized a bioinformatics exploratory analysis and identified gene ontology &quot;biological process&quot; classifications which revealed that dysregulated circulating miR-15b might be involved in phosphate metabolism. Furthermore, circulating miR-15b positively correlated with both estimated glomerular filtration rate (r = 0.502, p = 0.003) and hemoglobin levels (r = 0.432, p = 0.017) and inversely correlated with phosphate level (r = -0.516, p = 0.004). The findings indicated that the dysregulated miR-15b might contribute to the progression of ESRD by modulating genes that might be involved in the phosphate metabolism, which might have the potential of being used as a biomarker for monitoring disease.
