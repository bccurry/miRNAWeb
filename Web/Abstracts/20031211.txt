Micro-RNA-15a and micro-RNA-16 expression and chromosome 13 deletions in multiple myeloma. We have used copy number variation (CNV) analysis with SNP mapping arrays for miRNA-15a and miRNA-16-1 expression analysis in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) with or without deletion of chromosome 13q14. MiRNA-15a and miRNA-16 display a range of expression patterns in MM patients, independent of the chromosome 13 status. These findings suggest that genes other than miR-15a and miR-16 may explain the prognostic significance of 13q14 deletions.
