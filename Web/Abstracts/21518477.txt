[Differential expression of miR-143 in bone marrow cells between acute leukemia patients and normal people and its significance]. MicroRNA abnormality is closely related to the development of acute leukemia. This study was aimed to investigate the differential expression of miR-143 in bone marrow cells between patients with acute leukemia and normal people. Bone marrow cells from 50 AL patients and 20 normal people were collected respectively and the total RNA was isolated routinely. The quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) method was used to detect the expression levels of miR-143 in these specimens. The results showed that compared with the normal people, the expression of miR-143 in AL patients was significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05), which significantly increased after complete remission; besides, the expression of miR-143 was negatively correlated with the expression of DNMT3A mRNA, a known target gene of miR-143. It is concluded that the expression of miR-143 in bone marrow cells of AL patients is down-regulated which may be related with the development of acute leukemia.
