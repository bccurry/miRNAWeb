A polymorphism at the miR-502 binding site in the 3' untranslated region of the SET8 gene is associated with the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) bind to the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of messenger RNAs, where they interfere with the translation of genes that regulate cell differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. SET8 reportedly methylates TP53 and regulates genomic stability. We analyzed a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs16917496) within the miR-502 mRNA seed region of the 3' UTR of SET8 in Chinese epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. The SET8 CC genotype was associated with a decreased risk of EOC in this case-control study. The analysis of genetic polymorphisms in miRNA binding sites may help identify subgroups of populations that are at high risk for EOC.
