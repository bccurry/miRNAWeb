Hsa-miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism contributes to cancer risk: a meta-analysis of 12 studies. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurred in pre-microRNAs or targets of microRNAs (miRs) may contribute to cancer risks. Since 2007, many studies have investigated the association between common SNPs located on hsa-miR-499 (rs3746444) and cancer risks; however, the results were inconclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis of 12 studies that included 5765 cases and 7076 controls to identify the strength of association. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were used to assess the strength of association. Overall, individuals with the variant AG (OR=1.215, 95% CI: 1.027, 1.437; P(heterogeneity)&lt;0.01) and AG/GG (OR=1.227, 95% CI: 1.046, 1.439; P(heterogeneity)&lt;0.01) genotypes were associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer than those with wild AA genotype. Sub-group analysis revealed that the variant AG (OR=1.411, 95% CI: 1.142, 1.745; P(heterogeneity)=0.01) and AG/GG (OR=1.413, 95% CI: 1.163, 1.717, P(heterogeneity)=0.01) genotypes still showed an increased risk of cancer in Asians; however, a trend of reduced risk of cancer was observed in Caucasians (AG vs. AA: OR=0.948, 955 CI: 0.851, 1.057, P(heterogeneity)=0.12; AG/GG vs. AA: OR=0.959, 95% CI: 0.865, 1.064; P(heterogeneity)=0.19). Meta-regression showed that ethnicity (p=0.048) and sample size (p=0.02) but not cancer types (p=0.89) or source of control (p=0.97) were the sources of heterogeneity. These meta-analysis results suggest that hsa-miR-499 polymorphism rs3746444 is associated with a significantly increased risk of cancer, especially in Asian populations.
