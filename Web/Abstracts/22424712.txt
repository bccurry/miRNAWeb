Notch-mediated repression of miR-223 contributes to IGF1R regulation in T-ALL. To identify microRNAs regulated by oncogenic Notch signaling, we performed microarray-based miRNA profiling of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells before and after treatment with -secretase inhibitor (GSI) to block Notch signaling. We show miR-223 levels increase after GSI treatment suggesting that active Notch signaling represses miR-223 expression. We also demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) is regulated by miR-223 in this context, but observe no apparent effects on cell growth by overexpression or knock-down of miR-223 alone. We conclude that miR-223 contributes to IGF1R regulation, but may act in concert with other genes and/or microRNAs to alter T-ALL biology.
