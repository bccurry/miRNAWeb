Association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms in pre-miRNA and rheumatoid arthritis in a Han Chinese population. The aim of this study was to perform an association study between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2910164 G&gt;C and rs3746444 T&gt;C in pre-miRNA (hsa-mir-146a and hsa-mir-499) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the Han Chinese population. 208 Han Chinese patients with RA and 240 healthy controls were recruited in this study. The SNPs was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and rheumatoid factor (RF) was measured by rate nephelometry. The genotype frequencies between cases and controls were compared by (2) analysis. No significant association between the SNPs (rs2910164 and rs3746444) and RA was observed (P = 0.631 and 0.775, respectively), and the SNPs did not show any association with the RF-positive (P = 0.631 and 0.775, respectively). However, there was a significant difference on the level of anti-CCP antibody between different genotypes in rs3746444 (P = 0.007). The heterozygote CT had significantly higher level of anti-CCP antibody compared with homozygote CC and TT (P = 0.054 and 0.003, respectively). We first investigated the association between the SNPs (rs2910164 G&gt;C and rs3746444 T&gt;C) in the pre-miRNA (hsa-mir-146a and hsa-mir-499) and RA in a Han Chinese population. We did not find a significant association between the SNPs and the susceptibility to RA, while the SNP rs3746444 may affect anti-CCP antibody production.
