miR-126 inhibits proliferation of small cell lung cancer cells by targeting SLC7A5. Despite intensive efforts to improve therapies, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) still has a dismal median survival of 18 months. Since miR-126 is under-expressed in the majority of SCLC tumors, we investigated the effect of miR-126 overexpression on the proliferation and cell cycle distribution of H69 cells. Our results demonstrate that miR-126 inhibits proliferation of H69 cells, by delaying the cells in the G1 phase. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated suppression of SLC7A5, a predicted target of mir-126, has the same effect on H69 cells. We also show for the first time that SLC7A5 is a direct target of miR-126.
