MicroRNA-182 targets cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 and suppresses cell growth in human gastric adenocarcinoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Recent evidence indicates that many miRNAs function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors by negatively regulating their target genes. In our previous study, using miRNA microarray analysis, we found that miRNA-182 (miR-182) was significantly downregulated in human gastric adenocarcinoma tissue samples. Here, we confirmed the downregulation of miR-182 in a larger sample of gastric tissue samples. Overexpression of miR-182 suppressed the proliferation and colony formation of gastric cancer cells. An oncogene, encoding cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1), serves as a direct target gene of miR-182. A fluorescent reporter assay confirmed that miR-182 binds specifically to the predicted site of the CREB1 mRNA 3'-UTR. When miR-182 was overexpressed in gastric cancer cell lines, both the mRNA and protein levels of CREB1 were depressed. Furthermore, CREB1 was present at a high level in human gastric adenocarcinoma tissues, and this was inversely correlated with miR-182 expression. Ectopic expression of CREB1 overcame the suppressive phenotypes of gastric cancer cells caused by miR-182. These results indicate that miR-182 targets the CREB1 gene and suppresses gastric adenocarcinoma cell growth, suggesting that miR-182 shows tumor-suppressive activity in human gastric cancer.
