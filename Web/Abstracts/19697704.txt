[The expression pattern and possible function of microRNA-34a in neurons]. Using Northern blotting, ISH and FISH, we demonstrated miR-34a expresses with aging in the brain of rhesus monkey and rat. Correspondingly, the same trend was found in the primary cultures of cortical neurons. Moreover, we found that induction of miR-34a led to neuronal apoptosis by targeting BCL-2. Our study suggests that miR-34a may play critical roles in neuronal development and ageing.
