Epigenetic silencing of the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster during PU.1-directed macrophage differentiation. The oncogenic cluster miR-17-92 encodes seven related microRNAs that regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis and development. Expression of miR-17-92 cluster is decreased upon cell differentiation. Here, we report a novel mechanism of the regulation of miR-17-92 cluster. Using transgenic PU.1(-/-) myeloid progenitors we show that upon macrophage differentiation, the transcription factor PU.1 induces the secondary determinant Egr2 which, in turn, directly represses miR-17-92 expression by recruiting histone demethylase Jarid1b leading to histone H3 lysine K4 demethylation within the CpG island at the miR-17-92 promoter. Conversely, Egr2 itself is targeted by miR-17-92, indicating existence of mutual regulatory relationship between miR-17-92 and Egr2. Furthermore, restoring EGR2 levels in primary acute myeloid leukaemia blasts expressing elevated levels of miR-17-92 and low levels of PU.1 and EGR2 leads to downregulation of miR-17-92 and restored expression of its targets p21CIP1 and BIM. We propose that upon macrophage differentiation PU.1 represses the miR-17-92 cluster promoter by an Egr-2/Jarid1b-mediated H3K4 demethylation mechanism whose deregulation may contribute to leukaemic states.
