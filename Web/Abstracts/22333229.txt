[Regulation of microRNA-199a on adhesion, migration and invasion ability of human endometrial stromal cells]. To study the regulation of microRNA 199a (miR-199a) on adhesion, migration and invasion ability of human eutopic endometrial stromal cells (ESC) from patients with endometriosis. ESC were transfected with miR-199a mimics or negative control (NC) RNA by lipofectamine 2000. The adhesion, migration and invasion ability of ESC were detected by cell adhesion assay, scratch assay, cell migration assay and matrigel invasion assay, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate whether IKK was the target gene of miR-199a. The expression of ikappa B kinase beta (IKK), inhibitory kappa B alpha (IB-), phospho-IB-(p-IB-) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) protein were measured by western blot. (1) Adhesion potential: the adhesion inhibitory rates were (14  4)% in miR-199a group and 0 in control group, which showed significant difference (P &lt; 0.01). (2) Migration and invasion: in the scratch assay, ESC transfected with miR-199a exhibited a lower scratch closure rate than that of controls. In migration and invasion assays, the migration and invasion ability of miR-199a group were significantly decreased compared with those of NC group [130  31 vs. 247  36 (P &lt; 0.01); 63  15 vs. 133  17 (P &lt; 0.01), respectively]. (3) The luciferase activity of miR-199a group was significantly lowered than that of control group [0.160  0.006 vs. 0.383  0.083 (P &lt; 0.01)]. The protein levels of IKK, p-IB-, IB- and NF-B of 0.350  0.195, 0.443  0.076, 1.970  0.486 and 0.454  0.147 in miR-199a group were significantly different compared with the NC group in which the protein levels were set at 1.000 (P &lt; 0.01). miR-199a can inhibit the adhesion, migration and invasion of the ESC. IKK is the target gene of miR-199a in ESC. One of the mechanisms of the inhibition effect is probably that miR-199a inhibits the activation of NF-B signaling pathway by targeting IKK gene.
