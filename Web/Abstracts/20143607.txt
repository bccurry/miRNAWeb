[Clinical and cytogenetic factors of prognosis in glial tumors of the brain]. The purpose of this study is to assess clinical, morphofunctional and molecular factors of prognosis in patients with malignant cerebral gliomas. Retrospective analysis of follow-up of surgical and complex treatment of 95 patients with cerebral gliomas was performed. The series included 81 primary case and 14 recurrent cases. In all patients age, sex, clinical, topographic, morphological and therapeutic factors were analyzed. In 47 patients molecular and genetic prognostic factors including p51, MGMT, p16, PTEN and hyperproduction of miRNA21 in tumor cells were investigated. We established significant prognostic factors for cerebral gliomas. They include: histological nature, age, sex, comorbidity. Complex treatment of glial tumors (surgical resection + radiation therapy) correlated with longer life expectancy in comparison with patients who received only surgical treatment. Patients wish mutations in tumor cells had longer survival period in comparison with mutation-free patients. This finding allows application of molecular and genetic tumor markers as independent prognostic factors in glial cerebral tumors.
