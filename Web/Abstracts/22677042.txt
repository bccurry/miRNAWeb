MiR-222 modulate multidrug resistance in human colorectal carcinoma by down-regulating ADAM-17. Colorectal carcinoma is a frequent cause of cancer-related death in the world for men and women. MicroRNAs are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression negatively at posttranscriptional level. Here we investigated the role of ADAM-17 (a desintegrin and metalloproteases 17) in multidrug-resistant colorectal carcinoma (CRC) as a novel multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanism and miR-222 in the development of MDR in CRC cells.We found the high expression of ADAM-17 which results in growth factor shedding, growth factor receptor activation could induce drug resistance in CRC. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of ADAM-17 in conjunction with chemotherapy may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of CRC. Meanwhile ADAM-17 is a predicted target of miR-222 which was downregulated in multidrug-resistant CRC cells and consistent reversely with expression levels of ADAM-17. Furthermore, we found that elevated levels of miR-222 in the mimics-transfected HCT116/L-OHP and HCT-8/VCR cells reduced ADAM-17 protein level and the luciferase activity of a ADAM-17 3' untranslated region-based reporter, and also sensitized these cells apoptosis to some anticancer drugs. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-222 could play a role in the development of MDR by modulation of ADAM-17 the new MDR treatment target in colorectal carcinoma cells.
