Up-Regulation of miR-182 Expression after Epigenetic Modulation of Human Melanoma Cells. PURPOSE: We sought to investigate the epigenetic regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in melanoma. METHODS: We treated two highly metastatic human melanoma cell lines, C8161.9 and WM266-4, with the demethylating agents DAC (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and trichostatin A. Locked nucleic acid-based miRNA expression profiling was utilized to examine the differential expression of miRNAs before and after treatment. RESULTS: We found that miR-182, a miRNA with oncogenic properties, was significantly up-regulated in human melanoma cells after epigenetic modulation. Genome sequence analysis revealed the presence of a prominent CpG island 8-10kb upstream of mature miR-182. Methylation analysis showed that this genomic region was exclusively methylated in melanoma cells but not in human melanocytes, skin, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that an epigenetic mechanism is likely involved in modulating the expression level of miR-182 in melanoma, and increased expression of oncogenic-like miR-182 could be a concern for melanoma patients after epigenetic therapy.
