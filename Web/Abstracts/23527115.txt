No correlation of hsa-miR-148a with expression of PXR or CYP3A4 in human livers from Chinese Han population. There is a huge variability of hepatic CYP3A4 level in human populations, which was believed to contribute to different responses to drugs among individuals. Transcription of CYP3A4 was regulated by transcription factors such as pregnane X receptor (PXR). MiRNA hsa-miR-148a was previously reported to influence PXR expression in HepG2 cells and in Japanese populations. In this study, we conducted a similar correlation study in Chinese Han population (N=24). No significant correlation of hsa-miR-148a was found with PXR expression or CYP3A4 expression. Our results suggest that hsa-miR-148a does not play a major role in the regulation of PXR or CYP3A4 expression in human livers from Chinese Han population.
