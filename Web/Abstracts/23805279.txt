Identification of Host Kinase Genes Required for Influenza Virus Replication and the Regulatory Role of MicroRNAs. Human protein kinases (HPKs) have profound effects on cellular responses. To better understand the role of HPKs and the signaling networks that influence influenza virus replication, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen of 720 HPKs was performed. From the screen, 17 HPKs (NPR2, MAP3K1, DYRK3, EPHA6, TPK1, PDK2, EXOSC10, NEK8, PLK4, SGK3, NEK3, PANK4, ITPKB, CDC2L5 (CDK13), CALM2, PKN3, and HK2) were validated as essential for A/WSN/33 influenza virus replication, and 6 HPKs (CDK13, HK2, NEK8, PANK4, PLK4 and SGK3) were identified as vital for both A/WSN/33 and A/New Caledonia/20/99 influenza virus replication. These HPKs were found to affect multiple host pathways and regulated by miRNAs induced during infection. Using a panel of miRNA agonists and antagonists, miR-149* was found to regulate NEK8 expression, miR-548d-3p was found to regulate MAPK1 transcript expression, and miRs -1228 and -138 to regulate CDK13 expression. Up-regulation of miR-34c induced PLK4 transcript and protein expression and enhanced influenza virus replication, while miR-34c inhibition reduced viral replication. These findings identify HPKs important for influenza viral replication and show the miRNAs that govern their expression.
