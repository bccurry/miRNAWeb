Activation of hepatitis C virus translation by a liver-specific microRNA. microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of translation of many mRNAs and affect cell cycle progression, differentiation and metabolism. The liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122) contributes to the liver tropism of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) by accelerating the binding of ribosomes to the viral RNA and thereby stimulating HCV translation. Here, the most recent results on the molecular mechanisms of microRNA action on HCV and the implications for the understanding of translation regulation by microRNAs are discussed.
