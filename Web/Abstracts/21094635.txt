Differences in islet-enriched miRNAs in healthy and glucose intolerant human subjects. Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to be cell-type specific and are implicated in development of diseases. We investigated the global expression pattern of miRNAs in human pancreatic islets compared to liver and skeletal muscle, using bead-based technology and quantitative RT-PCR. In addition to the known islet-specific miR-375, we also found enrichment of miR-127-3p, miR-184, miR-195 and miR-493 in the pancreatic islets. The expression of miR-375, miR-127-3p, miR-184 and the liver-enriched miR-122 is positively correlated to insulin biosynthesis, while the expression of miR-127-3p and miR-184 is negatively correlated to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). These correlations were absent in islets of glucose intolerant donors (HbA1c  6.1). We suggest that the presence of an islet-specific miRNA network, which consists of at least miR-375, miR-127-3p and miR-184, potentially involved in insulin secretion. Our results provide new insight into miRNA-mediated regulation of insulin secretion in healthy and glucose intolerant subjects.
