MicroRNA expression profiling of exfoliated colonocytes isolated from feces for colorectal cancer screening. To reduce the colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality rate, we have reported several CRC screening methods using colonocytes isolated from feces. Expression analysis of oncogenic microRNA (miRNA) in peripheral blood was recently reported for CRC detection. In the present study, we conducted miRNA expression analysis of exfoliated colonocytes isolated from feces for CRC screening. Two hundred six CRC patients and 134 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. miRNA expression of the miR-17-92 cluster, miR-21, and miR-135 in colonocytes isolated from feces as well as frozen tissues was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of the miR-17-92 cluster, miR-21, and miR-135 was significantly higher in CRC tissues compared with normal tissues. The exfoliated colonocytes of 197 CRC patients and 119 healthy volunteers were analyzed because of the presence of sufficient miRNA concentration. miR-21 expression did not differ significantly between CRC patients and healthy volunteers (P = 0.6). The expression of miR-17-92 cluster and miR-135 was significantly higher in CRC patients than in healthy volunteers (P &lt; 0.0001). The overall sensitivity and specificity by using miRNA expression was 74.1% (146/197; 95% confidence interval, 67.4-80.1) and 79.0% (94/119; 95% confidence interval, 70.6-85.9), respectively. Sensitivity was dependent only on tumor location (P = 0.0001). miRNA was relatively well conserved in exfoliated colonocytes from feces both of CRC patients and healthy volunteers. miRNA expression analysis of the isolated colonocytes may be a useful method for CRC screening. Furthermore, oncogenic miRNA highly expressed in CRC should be investigated for CRC screening tests in the future.
