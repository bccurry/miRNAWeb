MicroRNA-34a inhibits human osteosarcoma proliferation by downregulating ether  go-go 1 expression. Aberrant expression of MicroRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in several types of cancer. As a direct target gene of p53, miR-34a has been suggested to mediate the tumor suppressor function of p53. Ether  go-go 1 (Eag1) channel is overexpressed in a variety of cancers and plays important roles in cancer progression. However, the link between miR-34a and Eag1 in cancer is unclear. In this study, we used human osteosarcoma as the model to demonstrate that miR-34a was significantly downregulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines compared with normal brain tissues and osteoblastic cell line. Next we evaluated the role of miR-34a in the regulation of osteosarcoma cell proliferation by CCK-8 and colony formation assays. The results showed that overexpression of miR-34a inhibited the proliferation of MG-63 and Saos-2 cells. Furthermore, xenograft nude mice model showed that miR-34a inhibited osteosarcoma growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that overexpression of miR-34a led to decreased Eag1 expression in osteosarcoma cells while inhibition of miR-34a increased Eag1 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-34a could inhibit osteosarcoma growth via the down regulation of Eag1 expression.
