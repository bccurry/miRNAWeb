microRNA 184 regulates expression of NFAT1 in umbilical cord blood CD4+ T cells. The reduced expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFAT1) protein in umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived CD4+ T cells and the corresponding reduction in inflammatory cytokine secretion after stimulation in part underlies their phenotypic differences from adult blood (AB) CD4+ T cells. This muted response may contribute to the lower incidence and severity of high-grade acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) exhibited by UCB grafts. Here we provide evidence that a specific microRNA, miR-184, inhibits NFAT1 protein expression elicited by UCB CD4+ T cells. Endogenous expression of miR-184 in UCB is 58.4-fold higher compared with AB CD4+ T cells, and miR-184 blocks production of NFAT1 protein through its complementary target sequence on the NFATc2 mRNA without transcript degradation. Furthermore, its negative effects on NFAT1 protein and downstream interleukin-2 (IL-2) transcription are reversed through antisense blocking in UCB and can be replicated via exogenous transfection of precursor miR-184 into AB CD4+ T cells. Our findings reveal a previously uncharacterized role for miR-184 in UCB CD4+ T cells and a novel function for microRNA in the early adaptive immune response.
