MicroRNA-181a regulates local immune balance by inhibiting proliferation and immunosuppressive properties of mesenchymal stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit extensive self-renewal potential and can modulate immunocyte activation. Our previous study reported that miR-181a expression was significantly increased in placenta from women with severe preeclampsia (PE), but the mechanisms by which miR-181a regulates MSCs are unknown. In this study, we asked if and how miR-181a regulates MSCs' proliferation and immunosuppressive properties. We found that the expression of miR-181a in the MSCs derived from the umbilical cord and decidua of PE patients increased relative to MSCs derived from normal patients. Transfection with miR-181a oligos prevented MSCs proliferation but did not affect MSCs apoptosis. Overexpression of miR-181a blocked activation of the TGF- signaling pathway and caused downregulation of target gene (TGFBR1 and TGFBRAP1) mRNA and protein expression. Reporter genes with putative miR-181a binding sites from the TGFBR1 and TGFBRAP1 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) were downregulated in the presence of miR-181a, suggesting that miR-181a binds to TGFBR1 and TGFBRAP1 3'-UTRs. In contrast, transfection of MSCs with miR-181a oligo enhanced expression of IL-6 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by activating p38 and JNK signaling pathways, respectively. MSCs transfected with miR-181a also enhanced the proliferation of T cells in a short-term culture. Additionally, treatment with control MSCs, but not miR-181a transfected MSCs, improved dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis, suggesting that miR-181a attenuates the immunosuppressive properties of MSCs in vivo. Together, our data demonstrate that miR-181a is an important endogenous regulator in the proliferation and immunosuppressive properties of MSCs.
