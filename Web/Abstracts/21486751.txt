MicroRNA 130 family regulates the hypoxia response signal through the P-body protein DDX6. The transcription factor HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor 1) has an essential role in the maintenance of oxygen homeostasis in metazoans. HIF-1 expression and activity in the hypoxic response is regulated at the translation and post-translational levels. However, the mechanism and modulator of HIF-1 translation during hypoxia is not fully understood. We found that HIF-1 expression during hypoxia was upregulated by the microRNA 130 (miR-130) family. Levels of the miR-130 family are elevated under hypoxia, and their target is DDX6 mRNA, which is a component of the P-bodies. Furthermore, we found that a decrease of DDX6 expression by the miR-130 family enhanced the translation of HIF-1 in an internal ribosome entry site element-dependent manner. These results reveal a new HIF-1 translational mechanism and a role for P-bodies in hypoxic stress.
