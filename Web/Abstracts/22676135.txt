MiR-297 modulate multidrug resistance in human colorectal carcinoma by down-regulating MRP-2. Colorectal carcinoma is a frequent cause of cancer-related death in the world for men and women. MicroRNAs are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression negatively at posttranscriptional level. Here we investigated the possible role of microRNAs in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in colorectal carcinoma cells. We analyzed miRNA expression levels between multidrug resistant colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116/L-OHP and its parent cell line HCT116 using a miRNA microarray. MiR-297 had the lower expression of miRNA in HCT116/L-OHP cells compared to its parental cells. MRP-2 is an important MDR protein in platinum-drug resistance cells; meanwhile MRP-2 is a predicted target of miR-297. Additionally, miR-297 was downregulated in a panel of human colorectal carcinoma tissues and consistent reversely with expression levels of MRP-2. Furthermore, we found that ectopic expression of miR-297 in MDR colorectal carcinoma cells reduced MRP-2 protein level and sensitized these cells to anticancer drugs in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-297 could play a role in the development of MDR in colorectal carcinoma cells at least in part by modulation of MRP-2.
