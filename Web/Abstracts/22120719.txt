MiR-27b targets PPAR to inhibit growth, tumor progression and the inflammatory response in neuroblastoma cells. The peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway is involved in cancer, but it appears to have both tumor suppressor and oncogenic functions. In neuroblastoma cells, miR-27b targets the 3' untranslated region of PPAR and inhibits its mRNA and protein expression. miR-27b overexpression or PPAR inhibition blocks cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in mouse xenografts. PPAR activates expression of the pH regulator NHE1, which is associated with tumor progression. Lastly, miR-27b through PPAR regulates nuclear factor-B activity and transcription of inflammatory target genes. Thus, in neuroblastoma, miR-27b functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the tumor-promoting function of PPAR, which triggers an increased inflammatory response. In contrast, in breast cancer cells, PPAR inhibits NHE1 expression and the inflammatory response, and it functions as a tumor suppressor. We suggest that the ability of PPAR to promote or suppress tumor formation is linked to cell type-specific differences in regulation of NHE1 and other target genes.
