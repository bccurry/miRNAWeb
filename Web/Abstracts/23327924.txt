Inflammatory neovascularization during graft-versus-host disease is regulated by v integrin and miR-100. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a complex process involving endothelial damage and neovascularization. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of neovascularization during GvHD could help to target this process while leaving T-cell function intact. Under ischemic conditions, neovascularization is regulated by different micro RNAs (miRs), which potentially play a role in inflamed hypoxic GvHD target organs. We observed strong neovascularization in the murine inflamed intestinal tract (IT) during GvHD. Positron emission tomography imaging demonstrated abundant v3 integrin expression within intestinal neovascularization areas. To interfere with neovascularization, we targeted v integrin-expressing endothelial cells, which blocked their accumulation in the IT and reduced GvHD severity independent of immune reconstitution and graft-versus-tumor effects. Additionally, enhanced neovascularization and v integrin expression correlated with GvHD severity in humans. Expression analysis of miRs in the inflamed IT of mice developing GvHD identified miR-100 as significantly downregulated. Inactivation of miR-100 enhanced GvHD indicating a protective role for miR-100 via blocking inflammatory neovascularization. Our data from the mouse model and patients indicate that inflammatory neovascularization is a central event during intestinal GvHD that can be inhibited by targeting v integrin. We identify negative regulation of GvHD-related neovascularization by miR-100, which indicates common pathomechanistic features of GvHD and ischemia.
