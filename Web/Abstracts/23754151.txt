miR-708 acts as a tumor suppressor in human glioblastoma cells. Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal forms of human cancer, and new clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets are urgently required. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional and/or translational level by binding the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of target mRNAs. The dysregulated expression of several miRNAs has been reported to modulate glioma progression. In the present study, we defined the expression and function of miR-708, which, based on real-time PCR analysis, were downregulated in GBM cells. The overexpression of miR-708 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion and induced apoptosis in the human GBM cell lines A172 and T98G. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-708 reduced the expression of Akt1, CCND1, MMP2, EZH2, Parp-1 and Bcl2 in A172 and T98G cells. Taken together, our study suggests that miR-708 affects GBM cell proliferation and invasion, and induces apoptosis. It is suggested that miR-708 may play an important role as a tumor suppressor in GBM and it may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in GBM.
