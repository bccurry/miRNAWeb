Aberrant overexpression of microRNAs activate AKT signaling via down-regulation of tumor suppressors in natural killer-cell lymphoma/leukemia. The gene(s) responsible for natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma/leukemia have not been identified. In the present study, we found that in NK-cell lymphoma lines (n = 10) and specimens of primary lymphoma (n = 10), levels of miR-21 and miR-155 expression were inversely related and were significantly greater than those found in normal natural killer (CD3(-)CD56(+)) cells (n = 8). To determine the functions of these microRNAs in lymphomagenesis, we examined the effects of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting miR-21 (ASO-21) and/or miR-155 (ASO-155) in NK-cell lymphoma lines overexpressing one or both of these miRNAs. Conversely, cells showing little endogenous expression of miR-21 or miR-155 were transduced by the use of lentiviral vectors, leading to their overexpression. Reducing expression of miR-21 or miR-155 led to up-regulation of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), or Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1). ASO-21- and ASO-155-treated cell lines all showed down-regulation of phosphorylated AKT(ser473). Moreover, transduction with either miR-21 or miR-155 led to down-regulation of PTEN and PDCD4 or SHIP1 with up-regulation of phosphorylated AKT(ser473). Collectively, these results provide important new insight into the pathogenesis of NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia and suggest targeting miR-21 and/or miR-155 may represent a useful approach to treating NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia.
