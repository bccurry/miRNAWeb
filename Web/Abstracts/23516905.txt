[Analysis of the rs12720208 single-nucleotide polymorphism of the FGF20 gene in Russian patients with sporadic Parkinson's disease]. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease whose pathogenesis involves a number of genes and environmental factors. The FGF20 gene encoding the fibroblast growth factor and paying an important role neuron proliferation and survival is one of candidate genes of PD. There is evidence that this gene is also involved in the control of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene expression. The rs12720208 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the FGF20 gene has been found to be associated with PD; it has been located to the 3'-UTR binding site for microRNA-433, which is involved in the control of FGF20 expression. Therefore, the frequency distribution of rs12720208 genotypes in the FGF20 gene has been analyzed in a sample of patients with sporadic PD and a control sample of the Russian population. The results have not shown any effect of rs12720208 in the FGF20 gene on the risk of PD in patients residing in Russia (OR = 0.95, the 95% confidence interval (CI) is 0.55-1.63, p = 0.9).
