miR-24 up-regulation in oral carcinoma: positive association from clinical and in vitro analysis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in neoplastic process. miR-24 is localized on chromosome 9q22 and 19p13, regions frequently altered in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study showed that miR-24 was up-regulated in OSCC tissues relative to control samples. In addition, the plasma levels of miR-24 in OSCC patients were significantly higher than in control individuals. miR-24 expression was also higher in OSCC cell lines relative to normal oral keratinocytes. Experiments blocking miR-24 and using exogenous miR-24 expression indicated that miR-24 contributes to the growth of OSCC cells and that miR-24 may target p57. This study suggests that miR-24 is involved in the regulation of OSCC growth and that the miR-24's level in plasma may be validatable as a tumor marker for OSCC patients.
