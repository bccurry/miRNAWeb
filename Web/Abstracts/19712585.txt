Expression of miR-210 during erythroid differentiation and induction of gamma-globin gene expression. MicroRNAs (miRs) are a family of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs in a sequence specific manner, inducing translational repression or mRNA degradation. In this paper we have first analyzed by microarray the miR-profile in erythroid precursor cells from one normal and two thalassemic patients expressing different levels of fetal hemoglobin (one of them displaying HPFH phenotype). The microarray data were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis, and allowed us to identify miR-210 as an highly expressed miR in the erythroid precursor cells from the HPFH patient. When RT-PCR was performed on mithramycin-induced K562 cells and erythroid precursor cells, miR-210 was found to be induced in time-dependent and dose-dependent fashion, together with increased expression of the fetal gamma-globin genes. Altogether, the data suggest that miR-210 might be involved in increased expression of gamma-globin genes in differentiating erythroid cells.
