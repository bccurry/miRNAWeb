MicroRNA-205 directly regulates the tumor suppressor, interleukin-24, in human KB oral cancer cells. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a form of small noncoding RNA that regulates the expression of genes either by inhibiting mRNA translation or by inducing its degradation. Small microRNA play important roles in regulating a large number of cellular processes, including development, proliferation and apoptosis. This study examined the biological functions of miR-205 as a tumor suppressor in KB oral cancer cells. The results showed that miR-205 expression was significantly lower in KB oral cancer cells than in human normal oral keratinocytes. Furthermore, the miR-205 over-expressed in KB oral cancer cells increased the cell cytotoxicity and induced apoptosis through the activation of caspase-3/-7. The transfection of miR-205 into KB oral cancer cells strongly induced IL-24, a well known cytokine that acts as a tumor suppressor in a range of tumor tissues. In addition, miR-205 targeted the IL-24 promoter directly to induce gene expression. Overall, miR-205 has significant therapeutic potential to turn on silenced tumor suppressor genes by targeting them with miRNA.
