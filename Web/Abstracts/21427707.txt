MicroRNA-143 regulates human osteosarcoma metastasis by regulating matrix metalloprotease-13 expression. Pulmonary metastases are the main cause of death in patients with osteosarcoma, however, the molecular mechanisms of metastasis are not well understood. To detect lung metastasis-related microRNA (miRNA) in human osteosarcoma, we compared parental (HOS) and its subclone (143B) human osteosarcoma cell lines showing lung metastasis in a mouse model. miR-143 was the most downregulated miRNA (P &lt; 0.01), and transfection of miR-143 into 143B significantly decreased its invasiveness, but not cell proliferation. Noninvasive optical imaging technologies revealed that intravenous injection of miR-143, but not negative control miRNA, significantly suppressed lung metastasis of 143B (P &lt; 0.01). To search for miR-143 target mRNA in 143B, microarray analyses were performed using an independent RNA pool extracted by two different comprehensive miR-143-target mRNA collecting systems. Western blot analyses revealed that MMP-13 was mostly protein downregulated by miR-143. Immunohistochemistry using clinical samples clearly revealed MMP-13-positive cells in lung metastasis-positive cases, but not in at least three cases showing higher miR-143 expression in the no metastasis group. Taken together, these data indicated that the downregulation of miR-143 correlates with the lung metastasis of human osteosarcoma cells by promoting cellular invasion, probably via MMP-13 upregulation, suggesting that miRNA could be used to develop new molecular targets for osteosarcoma metastasis.
