[Microrna, evolution and cancer]. MicroRNAs are known as a posttranscriptional negative regulators of gene expression by binding to the 3'UTP of target mRNAs in cytoplasm. More than 1600 microRNAs expressed in human cells, are involved in the regulation of embryogenesis, differentiation, cell cycle, apoptosis, senescence, thus determining cell fate. Up to 60 % of protein coding genes are under their control. Various sets of microRNAs found in different human tissues under normal and pathological conditions, including cancer, suggest that miRNAs are involved in most cellular pathways. To date, there is no doubt that regulatory potential of the genome is largely determined by miRNAs. In our study, we performed a comparative phylogenetic analysis of the origin and evolution of the total set of 1048 miRNAs in the human genome and investigated the role of certain miRNAs in carcinogenesis of thyroid and mammary glands, as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of malignancy. Analysis of phylogenetic distribution of miRNAs in the human genome has shown four peaks of appearance of new miRNA genes in the evolution from Methazoa to H. sapiens. The highest amount of new miRNA genes appeared after divergence of H. s. from common ancestor with P. t. Expansion of transposable elements in genome was accompanied by the origin of new miRNA genes on the basis of their sequences. More than 14 % from 1600 miRNAs of human genome originated from mobile elements and still remain. Profiles of expression of 5 miRNAs, pertaining to oncomicroRNAs - miR-21, -221, -222, -155 and -205 - allow distinguishing ductal invasive carcinoma of mammary gland and thyroid papillary carcinoma. The data obtained suggest different ways and roles of participation of the same miRNAs in carcinogenesis of thyroid and mammary glands. So, these miRNAs and profiles of their expression might be used in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.
