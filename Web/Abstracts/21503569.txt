microRNA-182 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of human lung adenocarcinoma cells through its effect on human cortical actin-associated protein. Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide. The cortactin gene, CTTN, may play a pivotal role in the proliferation and invasion of tumors. A microRNA (miR-182) was cloned and used to study the expression of CTTN and its regulatory effects on the proliferation and invasion of the lung cancer cell line, A549. Cortactin protein and CTTN mRNA expression decreased in A549 cells that were transfected with the miR-182 expression plasmid. A cell proliferation assay indicated that miR-182 expression affected cell cycle regulation and suppressed proliferation of lung cancer cells in vitro. In addition, xenograft experiments confirmed the suppression of tumor growth in vivo, which was due to the promotion of apoptosis. In conclusion, endogenous mature miR-182 expression may have an important role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer through its interference with the target gene CTTN by epigenetic modification.
