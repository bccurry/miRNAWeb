miR-3928 activates ATR pathway by targeting Dicer. Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression have been observed in cells subjected to exogenous stresses, implying that miRNAs play an important role in cellular stress response; however, the underlying mechanism is still largely unknown. In the present study, we found that miR-3928 was implicated in cellular response to ionizing radiation. After exposed to X-rays, miR-3928 expression increased in 1.5 h and then decreased, meanwhile Dicer, a key component in the miRNA processing machinery, increased gradually. An oscillation was observed in the expression of both mature miR-3928 and Dicer mRNA from 2 h to 3.5 h in irradiated cells. Then, we verified that miR-3928 directly bound to the 3'-untranslated region of Dicer mRNA. Consequently, Dicer expression was suppressed and the maturation of other miRNAs including miR-185, miR-300, and miR-663, was inhibited. Overexpression of miR-3928 induced DNA damage, activated ATR, and phosphorylated Chk1 accompanied by G1 arrest. Taken together, these findings replenished ATR/Chk1 pathway by revealing a novel miRNA regulatory network in response to exogenous stress, in which miR-3928 plays an important role in regulating the expression of Dicer.
