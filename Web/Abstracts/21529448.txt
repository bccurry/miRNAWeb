Expression of MicroRNA-146a in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. To explore the expression pattern of microRNAs in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with an attempt to identify the role of microRNA in the pathogenesis of SLE. SLE-related genes were searched from the published literatures. Using the microRNA target gene prediction databases, we predicted the putative microRNA targets in these SLE-related genes. For some of the corresponding microRNAs (hsa-miR-146a), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the expression levels of these microRNAs in PBMCs of SLE patients (SLE group) and healthy controls (control group). The discrepancy of cycle threshold of hsa-miR-146a in PBMCs was significantly higher in SLE group (4.521.18) than in control group (2.761.38) (P=0.02), and the expression level of hsa-miR-146a was significantly lower in SLE group. The expression of hsa-miR-146a decreases in SLE patients, indicating that hsa-miR-146a may play a role in the pathogenesis of SLE.
