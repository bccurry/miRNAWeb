Aberrant MicroRNA-155 expression is an early event in the multistep progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is the most common noninvasive precursor to invasive pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Misexpression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is commonly encountered in invasive neoplasia; however, miRNA abnormalities in PanIN lesions have not been documented. Three candidate miRNAs (miR-21, miR-155, and miR-221) previously reported as overexpressed in pancreatic cancers were assessed in 31 microdissected PanINs (14 PanIN-1, 9 PanIN-2, 8 PanIN-3) using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Subsequently, miR-155 was evaluated by locked nucleic acid in situ hybridization (LNA-ISH) in PanIN tissue microarrays. Relative to microdissected non-neoplastic ductal epithelium, significant overexpression of miR-155 was observed in both PanIN-2 (2.6-fold, p = 0.02) and in PanIN-3 (7.4-fold, p = 0.014), while borderline significant overexpression of miR-21 (2.5-fold, p = 0.049) was observed in PanIN-3 only. In contrast, no significant differences in miR-221 levels were observed between ductal epithelium and PanIN lesions by qRT-PCR. LNA-ISH confirmed the aberrant expression of miR-155 in PanIN-2 (9 of 20, 45%) and in PanIN-3 (8 of 13, 62%), respectively, when compared with normal ductal epithelium (0 of 10) (p &lt; 0.01). Abnormalities of miRNA expression are observed in the multistep progression of pancreatic cancer, with miR-155 aberrations demonstrable at the stage of PanIN-2, and miR-21 abnormalities at the stage of PanIN-3 lesions. and IAP.
