MicroRNA-125b inhibitor sensitizes human primary glioblastoma cells to chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide on invasion. Malignant gliomas are treated with a combination of surgery, radiation, and temozolomide (TMZ), but these therapies ultimately fail due to tumor recurrence. In this study, we aimed to identify the combined effects of miR-125b and TMZ involved in the invasive pathogenesis of glioblastoma cells. The effects of miR-125b and TMZ on cell invasion were analyzed by Transwell assays. Unexpectedly, either overexpression or downregulation of miR-125b has no function on glioblastoma cell invasion. However, knockdown of miR-125b could enhance the effects of TMZ on glioblastoma cell invasion. Conversely, overexpression of miR-125b could decrease such effects of TMZ. Further research on the mechanism demonstrated that such function of miR-125b knockdown on enhancing the effects of TMZ was involved in downregulation of Notch1. Notch1 was overexpressed in glioblastoma cells, and found by us that downregulation of Notch1 expression decreased the cell invasion of glioblastoma cells. Knockdown of miR-125b combined with TMZ enhancely downregulated Notch1 and inhibited cell invasion of malignant glioblastoma. These findings indicate that the combination of miR-125b inhibitor and TMZ treatment could effectively inhibit the glioblastoma cell invasion by inhibiting Notch1 expression.
