miR-802 regulates human angiotensin II type 1 receptor expression in intestinal epithelial C2BBe1 cells. Studies have demonstrated that angiotensin II (Ang II) can regulate intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport and control intestinal wall muscular activity. Ang II is also a proinflammatory mediator that participates in inflammatory responses such as apoptosis, angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling; accumulating evidence suggests that this hormone may be involved in gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and carcinogenesis. Ang II binds to two distinct G protein-coupled receptor subtypes, the AT(1)R and AT(2)R, which are widely expressed in the GI system. Together these studies suggest that Ang II-AT(1)R/-AT(2)R actions may play an important role in GI tract physiology and pathophysiology. Currently it is not known whether miRNAs can regulate the expression of the human AT(1)R (hAT(1)R) in the GI system. PCR and in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that miR-802 was abundantly expressed in human colon and intestine. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-802 could directly interact with the bioinformatics-predicted target site harbored within the 3'-untranslated region of the hAT(1)R mRNA. To validate that the levels of miR-802 were physiologically relevant in the GI system, we demonstrated that miR-802 &quot;loss-of-function&quot; experiments resulted in augmented hAT(1)R levels and enhanced Ang II-induced signaling in a human intestinal epithelial cell line. These results suggest that miR-802 can modulate the expression of the hAT(1)R in the GI tract and ultimately play a role in regulating the biological efficacy of Ang II in this system.
