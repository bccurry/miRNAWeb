MicroRNA-193b enhances tumor progression via down regulation of neurofibromin 1. Despite improvements in therapeutic approaches for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), clinical outcome has remained disappointing, with 5-year overall survival rates hovering around 40-50%, underscoring an urgent need to better understand the biological bases of this disease. We chose to address this challenge by studying the role of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in HNSCC. MiR-193b was identified as an over-expressed miRNA from global miRNA profiling studies previously conducted in our lab, and confirmed in HNSCC cell lines. In vitro knockdown of miR-193b in FaDu cancer cells substantially reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion, along with suppressed tumour formation in vivo. By integrating in silico prediction algorithms with in vitro experimental mRNA profilings, plus mRNA expression data of clinical specimens, neurofibromin 1 (NF1) was identified to be a target of miR-193b. Concordantly, miR-193b knockdown decreased NF1 transcript and protein levels significantly. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed the direct interaction of miR-193b with NF1. Moreover, p-ERK, a downstream target of NF1 was also suppressed after miR-193b knockdown. FaDu cells treated with a p-ERK inhibitor (U0126) phenocopied the reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion observed with miR-193b knockdown. Finally, HNSCC patients whose tumours expressed high levels of miR-193b experienced a lower disease-free survival compared to patients with low miR-193b expression. Our findings identified miR-193b as a potentially novel prognostic marker in HNSCC that drives tumour progression via down-regulating NF1, in turn leading to activation of ERK, resulting in proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumour formation.
