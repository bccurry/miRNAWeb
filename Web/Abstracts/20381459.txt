MicroRNA-650 targets ING4 to promote gastric cancer tumorigenicity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of target mRNAs. Altered expression of specific miRNAs in human gastric cancer progression has been reported; however, the role of miR-650 in gastric cancer is poorly understood. In this study, we show that miR-650 is involved in lymphatic and distant metastasis in human gastric cancer, and we find that ectopic expression of miR-650 promotes tumorigenesis and proliferation of gastric cancer cells. A luciferase reporter assay demonstrates that Inhibitor of Growth 4 (ING4) is a direct target of miR-650. Collectively, our study demonstrates that over-expression of miR-650 in gastric cancer may promote proliferation and growth of cancer cells, at least partially through directly targeting ING4. These findings help clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in gastric carcinogenesis and indicate that miR-650 modulation may be a bona fide miRNA-based treatment of gastric cancer.
