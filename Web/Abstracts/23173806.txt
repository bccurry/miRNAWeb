miR-210: a therapeutic target in cancer. As the predominant miRNA regulated by hypoxia, miR-210 correlates with survival in cancer patients. miR-210 may play important roles in regulation of cell growth, angiogenesis and apoptosis in different human tumor models, indicating that it can be used as a therapeutic target. This review covers all literature related to miR-210 in malignant tumors from the past 5 years, and analyzes the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of it. The authors also envisage future developments toward the clinical applications of miR-210 to cancer diagnosis and treatment. miR-210 may function as a new therapeutic target for anticancer intervention. Considering that the exact function of miR-210 is still not well characterized and understood, more investigations should be performed to promote the success of therapeutic-clinical use of miR-210 in cancer.
