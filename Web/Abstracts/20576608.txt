MicroRNA-208 modulates BMP-2-stimulated mouse preosteoblast differentiation by directly targeting V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1. MicroRNAs (miRs) represent a class of endogenous approximately 18-25 nucleotide RNAs that regulate gene expression through translational repression by binding to a target mRNA. These miRs regulate several biological functions, such as cell growth, cell differentiation, carcinogenesis, and so on. In a previous report, we have indicated that miR-141 and -200a act as preosteoblast differentiation modulators. In the present study, using microRNA array and in silico analyses, we found that miR-208 is closely involved in preosteoblast differentiation by partially regulating the expression of Ets1 (V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1), which transactivates osteopontin, runt-related transcription factor 2, parathyroid hormone-related protein, and type I procollagen. Furthermore, the enforced expression of mature miR-208 in murine preosteoblast in MC3T3-E1 cells or primary osteoblast cells remarkably attenuated BMP-2-induced preosteoblast differentiation. In addition, we determined that Ets1 is a target gene of miR-208 by using a sensor luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, these results suggest that the down-regulation of miR-208 in BMP-2-stimulated osteoblast differentiation is an important part of the regulatory machinery involved in early osteogenesis.
