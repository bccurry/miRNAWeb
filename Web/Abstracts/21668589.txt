miR126 positively regulates mast cell proliferation and cytokine production through suppressing Spred1. The protein known as Spred1 (Sprouty-related Ena/VASP homology-1 domain-containing protein) has been identified as a negative regulator of growth factor-induced ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Spred1 has also been implicated as the target of microRNA-126 (miR126), a miRNA located within the Egfl7 gene, and is involved in the regulation of vessel development through its role in regulating VEGF signaling. In this study, we examined the role of miR126 and Spred1 in the hematopoietic system, as miR126 has been shown to be overexpressed in leukemic cells. miR126 levels were down-regulated during mast cell differentiation from bone marrow cells, whereas Spred1 expression was inversely up-regulated. Overexpression of miR126 suppressed Spred1 expression and enhanced ERK activity in primary bone marrow cells and MC9 mast cells, which were associated with elevated FcRI-mediated cytokine production. To confirm the effect of Spred1 reduction in vivo, we generated hematopoietic cell-specific Spred1-conditional knockout mice. These mice showed increased numbers of mast cells, and Spred1-deficient bone marrow-derived mast cells were highly activated by cross-linking of Fc-R stimulation as well as by IL-3 and SCF stimulation. These results suggest that Spred1 negatively regulates mast cell activation, which is modulated by miR126.
