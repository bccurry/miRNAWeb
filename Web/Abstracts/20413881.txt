MiR-107 is reduced in Alzheimer's disease brain neocortex: validation study. MiR-107 is a microRNA (miRNA) that we reported previously to have decreased expression in the temporal cortical gray matter early in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we study a new group of well-characterized human temporal cortex samples (N=19). MiR-107 expression was assessed, normalized to miR-124 and let-7a. Correlation was observed between decreased miR-107 expression and increased neuritic plaque counts (P&lt; 0.05) and neurofibrillary tangle counts (P&lt; 0.02) in adjacent brain tissue. Adjusted miR-107 and BACE1 mRNA levels tended to correlate negatively (trend with regression P&lt; 0.07). In sum, miR-107 expression tends to be lower relative to other miRNAs as AD progresses.
