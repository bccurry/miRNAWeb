Prognostic value of miR-16 expression in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia relationships to normal and malignant lymphocyte proliferation. miR-16, a miRNA involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis regulation, may interfere with either oncogenic or tumor-suppressor pathways and is implicated in leukemogenesis. We then explored its expression in 93 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. A high miR-16 expression was associated with hyperleukocytosis and poor cytogenetic groups. In the whole group and in B-cell ALLs, disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly shorter for miR-16 above quartile 75. In T-cell ALLs, for both DFS and overall survival, a significant trend was found with a survival shortening from the lowest to the highest miR-16 levels. miR-16 expression neither significantly correlated with normal and malignant lymphocyte proliferation nor varied according to lymphocyte differentiation. The prognostic value of miR-16 in childhood ALL highlighted the complexity of miR-16 functions.
