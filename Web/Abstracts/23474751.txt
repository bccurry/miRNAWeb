Suppression of MIM by microRNA-182 activates RhoA and promotes breast cancer metastasis. Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women worldwide, and metastasis represents the most devastating stage of the disease. Recent studies have revealed that microRNAs (miRNA) have critical roles to regulate cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Here we present evidence to show the role of miR-182 in breast cancer metastasis. miR-182 is upregulated in the malignant cell line variants of both human MCF10 and mouse 4T1 series. Ectopic expression of miR-182 enhanced breast cancer cell motility and invasiveness, whereas miR-182 inhibition resulted in opposite changes. In nude mice, miR-182 led to increased pulmonary colonization of cancer cells. We further demonstrated that miR-182 directly targets MIM (Missing in Metastasis), which suppresses metastasis by inhibiting ras homolog family member A (RhoA) activity and stress fiber formation in breast cancer cells. Restoring MIM expression completely blocked the pro-metastasis function of miR-182, while RhoA inhibition reversed the phenotypes of both miR-182 overexpression and MIM knockdown. In breast tumor samples, miR-182 induction is linked to downregulation of MIM, RhoA activation and poor prognosis. Hence, our data delineates the molecular pathway by which miR-182 promotes breast cancer invasion and metastasis, and may have important implication for the treatment of metastatic cancers.Oncogene advance online publication, 11 March 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.65.
