Lack of association of miR-146a and Ets-1 gene polymorphisms with Fuchs uveitis syndrome in Chinese Han patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential association of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) and V-Ets oncogene homolog 1 (Ets-1) gene polymorphisms with Fuchs Uveitis syndrome (FUS). Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), miR-146a/rs2910164, ets-1/rs1128334, and ets-1/rs10893872 were genotyped in 219 Han Chinese patients with FUS and 612 healthy controls using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Genotype counts were analyzed by the  test. No significant difference concerning the genotypic and allelic frequencies of rs2910164, rs1128334, and rs10893872 polymorphisms could be found between patients with FUS and the normal controls. Analysis according to gender did not show any influence of sex on the association of miR-146a and Ets-1 with FUS. Our results suggest that the investigated three SNPs, miR-146a/rs2910164, ets-1/rs1128334, and ets-1/rs10893872, are not associated with FUS in the Han Chinese population.
