MicroRNA-146a modulates human bronchial epithelial cell survival in response to the cytokine-induced apoptosis. MicroRNA plays an important role in cell differentiation, proliferation and cell death. The current study found that miRNA-146a was up-regulated in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in response to stimulation by TGF-beta1 plus cytomix (a mixture of IL-1beta, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha). TGF-beta1 plus cytomix (TCM) induced apoptosis in HBECs (3.4+/-0.6% of control vs 83.1+/-4.0% of TCM treated cells, p&lt;0.01), and this was significantly blocked by the miRNA-146a mimic (8.8+/-1.5%, p&lt;0.01). In contrast, a miRNA-146a inhibitor had only a modest effect on cell survival but appeared to augment the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to the cytokines. The MicroRNA-146a mimic appears to modulate HBEC survival through a mechanism of up-regulating Bcl-XL and STAT3 phosphorylation, and by this mechanism it could contribute to tissue repair and remodeling.
