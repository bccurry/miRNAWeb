High level of miR-221/222 confers increased cell invasion and poor prognosis in glioma. MiR-221 and miR-222 (miR-221/222), upregulated in gliomas, can regulate glioma cell cycle progression and apoptosis, respectively. However, the association of miR-221/222 with glioma cell invasion and survival remains unknown. Invasion capability of miR-221/222 was detected by mutiple analyses, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), transwell, wound healing and nude mouse tumor xenograft model assay. Further, the target of miR-221/222 was determined by luciferase reporter, western blot and gene rescue assay. The association of miR-221/222 with outcome was examined in fifty glioma patients. MiR-221/222 expression was significantly increased in high-grade gliomas compared with low-grade gliomas, and positively correlated with the degree of glioma infiltration. Over-expression of miR-221/222 increased cell invasion, whereas knockdown of miR-221/222 decreased cell invasion via modulating the levels of the target, TIMP3. Introduction of a TIMP3 cDNA lacking 3' UTR abrogated miR-221/222-induced cell invasion. In addition, knockdown of miR-221/222 increased TIMP3 expression and considerably inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft model. Finally, the increased level of miR-221/222 expression in high-grade gliomas confers poorer overall survival. The present data indicate that miR-221 and miR-222 directly regulate cell invasion by targeting TIMP3 and act as prognostic factors for glioma patients.
