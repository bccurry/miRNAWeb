MicroRNA-1285 inhibits the expression of p53 by directly targeting its 3' untranslated region. The well-known tumor suppressor p53 plays critical roles in the modulation of multiple cellular processes. The regulation of p53 is complicated and remains elusive. In this study, we used a high-throughput luciferase reporter screen to demonstrate that p53 can be regulated by microRNA-1285 (miR-1285). Notably, miR-612, which has the same seed sequence as miR-1285, cannot bind to the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of p53. Mutational analyses confirmed that the 3' UTR of p53 mRNA contains two miR-1285 target sites, which are nearly perfectly complementary to the mature miR-1285 sequence. Ectopic expression of miR-1285 inhibits expression of p53 mRNA and protein. In contrast, silencing of miR-1285 increases p53 expression. Furthermore, miR-1285 inhibits the transcription of p21, a master gene downstream of p53. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence that miR-1285 directly regulates the expression of p53 by directly targeting its 3' UTR.
