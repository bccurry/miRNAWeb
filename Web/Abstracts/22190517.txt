[Influence of miR-122 on IFN- treatment for HCV infection]. To investigate the influence of miR-122 on IFN- treatment for HCV infection. Huh7.5.1 cells infected with HCV were treated with miR-122 mimics (20 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, 400 nmol/L) and/or IFN- (1000 IU/ml). The relative expression of HCV RNA was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Huh7.5.1 cells were treated with different amounts of HCV (107 copies, 106 copies and 105 copies) and/or IFN- (1000 IU/ml). IFN- suppressed the replication of HCV in a time-dependent manner, resulting in a  83% reduction of HCV at 48 h. MiR-122 mimics facilitated replication of HCV RNA in a dose-dependent manner (P&lt;0.05). The antiviral effect of IFN- was inverted to levels of miR-122 mimics (20 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, 400 nmol/L), (73.3%  3.5% compared with 84%  4.5%, P&gt;0.05; 64.67%  5.5% compared with 84%  4.5%, P&gt;0.05; 56.33%  5.1% compared with 84%  4.5%, P&lt;0.05). The antiviral effect of IFN- was inverted to HCV load (105 copies group compared with 107 copies group, P&lt;0.05). MiR-122 facilitates replication of HCV RNA in the cell culture system; and the expression of miR-122 may partly counteract the anti-HCV effect of IFN-.
