MicroRNA-21 expression in neonatal blood associated with antenatal immunoglobulin E production and development of allergic rhinitis. The prevalence of allergic diseases has increased in the past decades. It is unknown whether expression of certain microRNAs (miRNAs) in neonatal leucocytes is correlated to IgE production and/or allergic diseases. This study investigated the association of miRNA expression in neonatal leucocytes with cord blood IgE (CBIgE) elevation and development of allergic disease. We screened for the expression of a panel of 157 miRNAs in mononuclear leucocytes from human umbilical cord blood (CB) samples with elevated CBIgE and tracked the association of down-regulated miRNA expression to the miRNA-targeted gene expression and to children with allergic rhinitis (AR). Among the initial screen of 10 CB samples with elevated CBIgE, expression of eight of the 157 miRNAs was low. Of these eight down-expressed miRNAs, three remained down-regulation in a validation with other 20 CB samples, and two of the three miRNAs, miR-21 and miR-126, were significantly lower in monocytes from AR children. Further analysis of mRNA expression of the miR-21-targeted genes identified that TGFBR2 expression on monocytes was significantly up-regulated in CB with elevated CBIgE, and in AR patients. Transfection of miR-21 precursor into monocytes from patients with AR increased miR-21 expression and decreased TGFBR2 expression. This study demonstrated the first in the literature that lower miR-21 expression in CB and increased TGFBR2 expression is associated with antenatal IgE production and development of AR.
