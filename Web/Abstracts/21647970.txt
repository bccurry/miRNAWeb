Post-transcriptional up-regulation of miR-21 by type I collagen. Composition of extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial to the establishment and maintenance of epithelial apical-basolateral polarity. Increased ECM rigidity caused by deposition of fibrillar collagen, for example, collagen type I (Col-1), promotes loss of epithelial polarity and tumor progression. microRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and fundamental cellular processes. The current study explored a link between microRNAs and Col-1 using organotypic three-dimensional culture in which epithelial cells are embedded within Matrigel, a mimic of basement membrane matrix (Matrigel 3-D). Matrigel 3-D culture of A549, MCF-7, and mK-ras-LE cells (lung and mammary epithelial cell lines) gave rise to acinus, an in vitro equivalent of apical-basolateral polarity that consists of a polarized monolayer of epithelial cells facing a central lumen. Supplementation of Col-1 disrupted acinus. Moreover, Col-1 up-regulated the expression of miR-21, a well-documented oncogenic microRNA, via a post-transcriptional mechanism. Similar post-transcriptional up-regulation of miR-21 correlated with deposition of Col-1 in a murine model of lung fibrogenesis. In summary, our findings link altered ECM composition/rigidity and the expression of oncogenic microRNAs. The current study also suggests a novel post-transcriptional mechanism for regulation of miR-21 expression at maturation from pre-miR-21 to mature miR-21.
