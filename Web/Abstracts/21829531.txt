MicroRNA-96 directly inhibits -globin expression in human erythropoiesis. Fetal hemoglobin, HbF ((2)(2)), is the main hemoglobin synthesized up to birth, but it subsequently declines and adult hemoglobin, HbA ((2)(2)), becomes predominant. Several studies have indicated that expression of the HbF subunit -globin might be regulated post-transcriptionally. This could be confered by 22-nucleotide long microRNAs that associate with argonaute proteins to specifically target -globin mRNAs and inhibit protein expression. Indeed, applying immunopurifications, we found that -globin mRNA was associated with argonaute 2 isolated from reticulocytes that contain low levels of HbF (&lt;1%), whereas association was significantly lower in reticulocytes with high levels of HbF (90%). Comparing microRNA expression in reticulocytes from cord blood and adult blood, we identified several miRNAs that were preferentially expressed in adults, among them miRNA-96. The overexpression of microRNA-96 in human ex vivo erythropoiesis decreased -globin expression by 50%, whereas the knock-down of endogenous microRNA-96 increased -globin expression by 20%. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays showed that microRNA-96 negatively regulates expression of -globin in HEK293 cells, which depends on a seedless but highly complementary target site located within the coding sequence of -globin. Based on these results we conclude that microRNA-96 directly suppresses -globin expression and thus contributes to HbF regulation.
