Down-regulation of inflammation-protective microRNAs 146a and 212 in monocytes of patients with postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis (PP) is thought to belong to the bipolar spectrum. Recently we described an immune activation signature in monocytes of patients with PP using gene expression profiling. Immune activation genes are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). We therefore profiled miRNA expression in monocytes of PP patients to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between PP and the healthy state. In a profiling study we carried out miRNA profiling using TaqMan array human microRNA A cards v2.0 and monocytes of 8 PP patients. Data were analyzed against monocytes of healthy postpartum women (CP). Nine miRNAs were selected and tested using individual Q-PCR in a larger validation study on monocytes of 20 PP patients, 20 CP and 20 healthy non-postpartum women (HC). In the validation study miR-146a expression was significantly down-regulated in the monocytes of first onset PP patients as compared to CP and HC; miR-212 expression was significantly down-regulated in PP patients with prior bipolar disorder. In silico miR-146a targeted 4 genes of the previously described monocyte activation signature in bipolar disorder; miR-212 targeted 2 of such genes. In a correlation study decreased expression of miR-146a in monocytes was related to decreased natural T regulator cells in PP patients; decreased miR-212 was correlated to increased Adrenomedulin and decreased IL-6 expression in monocytes and to higher Th2 cell levels. This study identified changes in miR-146a and -212 expression in PP. Since these miRNAs are linked to inflammation, the study strengthens the view that PP is an inflammation-like condition.
