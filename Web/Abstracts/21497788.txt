Embryonic ectoderm development protein is regulated by microRNAs in human neural tube defects. The objective of the study was to investigate the expression and regulation of polycomb group (PcG) proteins in human neural tube defects (NTDs). PcG proteins in human NTD fetuses and age-matched controls were detected by Western blot. The relation between PcG proteins and microribonucleic acids was predicted and confirmed by the bioinformatics method, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), dual-luciferase activity assay, and Western blot. The trimethyl condition of histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27) was detected by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence. Embryonic ectoderm development protein (EED) was differentially detected in placenta, cerebral cortex, and spinal cord from NTDs and age-matched controls. MiR-30b can interact with 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of Eed and regulate endogenous EED expression in neural tissues. In addition, we found an inverse relationship between the miR-30b expression and the amount of trimethyl H3K27. Differential expression of EED exists in the nerves system in human NTDs and that is regulated by miR-30b.
