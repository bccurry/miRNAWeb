Transcriptomic Analysis of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Rapid Progressors in Early HIV Infection Identifies a Signature Closely Correlated with Disease Progression. BACKGROUND: A substantial percentage (10%-15%) of HIV-infected individuals experience a sharp decline in CD4(+) T-cell counts and progress to AIDS quickly after primary infection. Identification of biomarkers distinguishing rapid progressors (RPs) vs chronic progressors (CPs) is critical for early clinical intervention and could provide novel strategies to facilitate vaccine design and immune therapy.METHODS: mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of RPs and CPs were investigated at 111 (22) days [mean (SD)] of HIV infection. The association of mRNA and miRNA expression with disease progression was examined by ROC analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.RESULTS: Pathway enrichment analysis showed that genes with deregulated expression in RPs were primarily involved in apoptosis pathways. Furthermore, we found that 5 miRNAs (miR-31, -200c, -526a, -99a, and -503) in RPs were significantly decreased compared to those in CPs (P &lt; 0.05). The decreased expression of these miRNAs was associated with a rapid disease of progression of HIV infection with a 94% predictive value as measured by the area under the curve. The upregulated predicted targets from the 5 signature miRNAs and all upregulated genes identified from mRNA microarray analysis converged to the apoptosis pathway. Moreover, overexpression of miR-31 in primary human T cells promoted their survival.CONCLUSIONS: Our results have identified a distinct transcriptomic signature in PBMCs of RPs and provided novel insights to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.
