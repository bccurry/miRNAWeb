Pathophysiology of translational regulation by microRNAs in multiple sclerosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a group of several hundred, small non-coding RNA molecules with a fundamental influence on the regulation of gene expression. Certain miRNAs are altered in blood cells of multiple sclerosis (MS), and active and inactive MS brain lesions have distinct miRNA expression profiles. Several miRNAs such as miR-155 or miR-326 are considerably overexpressed in active MS lesions versus controls, and mice lacking these miRNAs either through knock-out (miR-155) or by in vivo silencing (miR-326) show a reduction of symptoms in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model system for multiple sclerosis. This review describes miRNAs regulated in the blood or in brain lesions of MS patients in the context of their previously described functions in physiology and pathophysiology.
