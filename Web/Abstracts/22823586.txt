MiR-146a polymorphism is associated with asthma but not with systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in Mexican patients. Extensive research has shown that aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays an important role in innate and adaptive immune responses. The rs2910164 polymorphism has been identified as a functional variant, which affects the transcription and expression level of miR-146a and, thereby, contributes to the pathogenesis of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. To investigate whether the rs2910164 G/C polymorphism was associated with asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), we performed an association study in a pediatric Mexican cohort. We included 979 pediatric patients (asthma: 402, SLE: 367 and JRA: 210) and 531 control subjects without inflammatory or immune diseases. Genotyping was performed using the 5' exonuclease technique. The genotype distribution of the rs2910164 polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in each group. No significant differences were detected in the distribution of this polymorphism between cases and controls (P=0.108, 0.609 and 0.553 for subjects with asthma, JRA and SLE, respectively). However, stratification by gender showed a statistically significant difference between asthmatic and control females, where the C allele was significantly associated with protection to asthma (odds ratio=0.694, 95% confidence interval 0.519-0.929, P=0.0138). Our results provide evidence that rs2910164 may play a role in the susceptibility to childhood-onset asthma, but not SLE or JRA in Mexicans. Further association studies may contribute to determining the role of miR-146a single-nucleotide polymorphisms in immune-mediated diseases.
