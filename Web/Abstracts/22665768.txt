Temporal expression of microRNA cluster miR-17-92 regulates effector and memory CD8+ T-cell differentiation. MicroRNAs are important regulators of various developmental and physiological processes. However, their roles in the CD8(+) T-cell response are not well understood. Using an acute viral infection model, we show that microRNAs of the miR-17-92 cluster are strongly induced after T-cell activation, down-regulated after clonal expansion, and further silenced during memory development. miR-17-92 promotes cell-cycle progression of effector CD8(+) T cells, and its expression is critical to the rapid expansion of these cells. However, excessive miR-17-92 expression enhances mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and strongly skews the differentiation toward short-lived terminal effector cells. Failure to down-regulate miR-17-92 leads to a gradual loss of memory cells and defective central memory cell development. Therefore, our results reveal a temporal expression pattern of miR-17-92 by antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells during viral infection, the precise control of which is critical to the effector expansion and memory differentiation of CD8(+) T cells.
