Hyalinizing trabecular tumour of the thyroid-differential expression of distinct miRNAs compared with papillary thyroid carcinoma. To compare the expression pattern of five microRNAs (miRNAs) (146b, -181b, -21, -221, -222) of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and hyalinizing trabecular tumour of the thyroid (HTT). The expression pattern of five miRNAs known to be up-regulated in PTC was retrospectively analysed in 18 HTTs, adjacent normal thyroid tissue, 10 PTCs, 10 follicular adenomas and 10 non-toxic multinodular goitres (MNG) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using the TaqMan miRNA assay. Furthermore, the two common genetic alterations characteristic for PTC, the V600E mutation of the BRAF gene and RET/PTC 1 and 3 rearrangements, were determined in all HTTs. All miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in PTCs, whereas all miRNAs in HTT, normal thyroid tissue, adenomas, and MNGs were down-regulated. Calculating relative changes in gene expression, a 510-fold change of miRNA 146b between PTC and HTT could be observed followed by fold changes between 6.4 and 29 in the remaining miRNAs (P &lt; 0.001). All HTTs lacked BRAF mutations and RET/PTC rearrangements. Our findings do not support the concept that a high proportion of HTT represents a variant of PTC. It is suggested that HTTs lacking both a miRNA expression pattern characteristic for PTC and RET/PTC rearrangements are re-designated as 'hyalinizing trabecular adenomas'.
