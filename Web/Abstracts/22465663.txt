MiR-483-5p suppresses the proliferation of glioma cells via directly targeting ERK1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit tumor-specific expression signatures and play crucial roles in tumorigenesis by targeting oncogenes. Here, through analyzing the miRNA-array profiles of human glioblastoma tissues and the adjacent normal brain tissues, we found miR-483-5p was significantly down-regulated in gliomas, which was confirmed in both human glioma specimens and cell lines. The overexpression of miR-483-5p suppressed glioma cell proliferation and induced a G0/G1 arrest. In contrast, miR-483-5p inhibition promoted cell proliferation. Furthermore, by a dual-luciferase reporter assay and expression analysis, we identified extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) as a direct target of miR-483-5p. ERK1 knockdown can block cell proliferation induced by miR-483-5p inhibition. Thus, our findings provide the first evidence that miR-483-5p can serve as a tumor suppressor in gliomas.
