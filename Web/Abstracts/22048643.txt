Aberrant expression of miR-638 contributes to benzo(a)pyrene-induced human cell transformation. Identification of aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression during chemical carcinogen-induced cell transformation will lead to a better understanding of the substantial role of miRNAs in cancer development. To explore whether aberrant miRNAs expression can be used as biomarkers of chemical exposure in risk assessment of chemical carcinogenesis, we analyzed miRNA expression profiles of human bronchial epithelial cells expressing an oncogenic allele of H-Ras (HBER) at different stages of transformation induced by benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) by miRNA array. It revealed 12 miRNAs differentially expressed in HBER cells at both pretransformed and transformed stages. Differentially expressed miRNAs were confirmed in transformed cells and examined in 50 pairs of primary human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues using real-time PCR. Among these miRNAs, downregulation of miR-638 was found in 68% (34/50) of NSCLC tissues. However, the expression of miR-638 in HBER cells increased upon treatment of BaP in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of miR-638 was also examined in peripheral lymphocytes from 86 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)-exposed (PE) workers. We found that the average expression level of miR-638 in peripheral lymphocytes from 86 PE workers increased by 72% compared with control group. The levels of miR-638 were correlated with the concentration of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) and external levels of PAHs. Overexpression of miR-638 aggravated cell DNA damage induced by BaP, which might be mediated by suppression of breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), one of the target genes of miR-638. In summary, we suggest that miR-638 is involved in the BaP-induced carcinogenesis by targeting BRCA1.
