Cocktail blood biomarkers: prediction of clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Timely prediction of stroke outcomes is important for proper personalized treatment. In the present study, we aimed to develop cocktail blood biomarkers to increase prediction efficiency using a combination of hemostasis, inflammatory and repair-related biomarkers. 105 patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke were divided into good outcome group and poor outcome group by modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Cytokines including CD40L, IFN-, IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and TNF-, as well as hemostasis markers fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products (FDP), D-dimer, tissue plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 in plasma were examined by ELISA. Repair-related biomarker microRNA-210 (miR-210) was measured by real-time PCR. The prediction efficiency was explored by receiver operator characteristic analysis. We demonstrated that FDP, IL-6 and miR-210 levels were closely associated with mRS in stroke patients. The prediction sensitivity of FDP, IL-6 and miR-210 for stroke outcome was 72.0, 86.7 and 82.5%, respectively. Using a combination of biomarkers including FDP, IL-6 and miR-210, the prognostic sensitivity of ischemic stroke increased to 95.2%. The combination of FDP, IL-6 and miR-210 has a high sensitivity for predicting stroke recovery, it serves as a potential cocktail blood biomarker. It provides a novel approach for stroke prognosis.
