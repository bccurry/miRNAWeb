miR-93/106b and their host gene, MCM7, are differentially expressed in leiomyomas and functionally target F3 and IL-8. miR-93/106b and their host gene minichromosome maintenance complex component 7 (MCM7) reside at chr7q22, a region frequently rearranged in leiomyomas. We explored the expression of miR-93/106b in leiomyoma and paired myometrium (n = 63) from untreated and patients exposed to hormonal therapies (GnRH agonist, Depo-Provera, and oral contraceptives) from African-Americans and Caucasians and their regulatory functions in isolated paired (n = 15) leiomyoma and myometrial smooth muscle cells and the leiomyosarcoma cell line. At tissue level leiomyomas expressed significantly lower levels of miR-93 and elevated MCM7 as compared with myometrium with limited racial influence or hormonal exposure on their expression. Assessing the regulatory function of miR-93/106b through doxycycline-inducible lentiviral transduction in a microarray analysis, tissue factor (F3) and IL8 were identified as their possible targets. At the tissue level, leiomyomas expressed a significantly lower level of F3 and an elevated IL-8 level, which exhibited an inverse relationship with miR-93 but with limited racial or hormonal influences. The gain of function of miR-93/106b in leiomyoma smooth muscle cells, myometrial smooth muscle cells, and the leiomyosarcoma cell line dose dependently repressed F3 and IL8 through direct interactions with their respective 3'-untranslated region and indirectly through F3 repression inhibited IL8, CTGF, and PAI-1 expression, confirmed by using small interfering RNA silencing or factor Vlla (FVIIa) activation of F3, as well as reducing the rate of proliferation, while increasing caspase-3/7 activity. We concluded that differential expression of miR-93/106b and their direct and/or indirect regulatory functions on F3, IL8, CTGF, and PAI-1 expression, with key roles in inflammation and tissue turnover may be of significance in the outcome of leiomyoma growth and associated symptoms.
