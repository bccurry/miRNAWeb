Next-generation sequencing of microRNAs for breast cancer detection. It is reported that different microRNA (miRNA) profiles can be detected in the blood of cancer patients. We investigated that whether the key serum miRNAs could discriminate patients with and without breast cancer. This study was divided into three parts: (1) miRNA marker discovery using SOLiD sequencing-based miRNA profiling on cancerous and adjacent noncancerous breast tissue of one breast cancer patient; (2) marker selection and validation by real-time PCR on a small set of serum; (3) gene ontology analysis of the key miRNA target genes. Of genome-wide tissue miRNA expression analysis, five miRNAs were found to be altered more than fivefold by SOLiD sequencing (i.e., miR-29a, miR-23a, miR-23b, miR-192, and miR-21). All the five miRNAs were validated on the 20 breast cancer patients and 20 controls. miR-29a and miR-21 were significantly increased in the serum of breast cancer patients (P &lt; .05). Gene ontology analysis of the target genes revealed enrichment for special biological process categories, that is, signal transduction, development, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cell adhesion. SOLiD sequencing provides a promising method for cancer-related miRNA profiling. Serum miRNAs may be useful biomarkers for breast cancer detection.
