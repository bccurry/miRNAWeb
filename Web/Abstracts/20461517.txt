Expression of microRNA-451 in normal and thalassemic erythropoiesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are negative regulators of gene expression that play an important role in hematopoiesis. Thalassemia, a defective globin synthesis leading to precipitate of excess unbound globins in red blood cell precursors, results in defective erythroid precursors and ineffective erythropoiesis. Expression pattern of miR-451, an erythroid-specific miRNA, was analyzed during differentiation of erythroid progenitors derived from normal and thalassemic peripheral blood CD34-positive cells, after 14 days of culture. A biphasic expression with transient up-regulation of miRNA-451 on day 3 of cultures was observed during thalassemic erythroid differentiation. In contrast, the expression pattern of the miR-451 in erythroid cells obtained from the other extravascular hemolytic anemia, i.e., hereditary spherocytosis patients showed no transient up-regulation of miR-451 on day 3 of cultures. Our results suggest that early erythroid progenitors in beta-thalassemia have a dysregulated miRNA-451 expression program, and analysis of microRNA is a relevant approach to determine abnormalities of erythropoiesis.
