Tumor necrosis factor -induced microRNA-18a activates rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts through a feedback loop in NF-B signaling. To elucidate whether the microRNA (miRNA) cluster miR-17-92 contributes to the activated phenotype of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs). RASFs were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor  (TNF), and the expression and regulation of the miR-17-92 cluster were studied using real-time quantitative PCR (PCR) and promoter activity assays. RASFs were transfected with single precursor molecules of miRNAs from miR-17-92 and the expression of matrix-degrading enzymes and cytokines was measured by quantitative PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Potential miRNA targets were identified by computational prediction and were validated using reporter gene assays and Western blotting. The activity of NF-B signaling was determined by reporter gene assays. We found that TNF induces the expression of miR-17-92 in RASFs in an NF-B-dependent manner. Transfection of RASFs with precursor molecules of single members of miR-17-92 revealed significantly increased expression levels of matrix-degrading enzymes, proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in precursor miR-18a (pre-miR-18a)-transfected RASFs. Using reporter gene assays, we identified the NF-B pathway inhibitor TNF-induced protein 3 as a new target of miR-18a. In addition, pre-miR-18a-transfected RASFs showed stronger activation of NF-B signaling, both constitutively and in response to TNF stimulation. Our data suggest that the miR-17-92-derived miR-18a contributes to cartilage destruction and chronic inflammation in the joint through a positive feedback loop in NF-B signaling, with concomitant up-regulation of matrix-degrading enzymes and mediators of inflammation in RASFs.
