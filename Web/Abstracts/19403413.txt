[Detection of miR-122a and miR-224 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR]. To detect the expressions of miR-122 and miR-224 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR and investigate the significance of miRNAs in early diagnosis of HCC. 2(-Delta Delta CT) method was used for quantitative analysis of the expression pattern of miR-122 and miR-224 in 35 HCC and adjacent normal tissues. All the quantitative results were confirmed by Northern blotting. Compared with adjacent normal tissues, the HCC tissues showed significant miR-122 down-regulation (P&lt;0.01) and miR-224 over-expression (P&lt;0.001). HCC has obvious alteration in the expression patterns of miR-122 and miR-224, and real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR provide a new means for early, efficient, and accurate diagnosis of HCC.
