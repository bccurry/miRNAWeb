miR-486-5p Induces Replicative Senescence of Human Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Its Expression Is Controlled by High Glucose. The reduction of adult stem cell self-renewal can be an important mechanism of aging. MicroRNAs have been reported to be involved in aging processes. Through a microarray approach, we have identified miR-486-5p, the expression of which is progressively expressed in human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAT-MSCs) with aging. Overexpression of miR-486-5p induces a premature senescence-like phenotype and inhibits proliferation of hAT-MSCs and inhibits adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, whereas inhibition of miR-486-5p has the opposite effects. miR-486-5p regulates the expression of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a major regulator of longevity and metabolic disorders. Decrease of SIRT1 deacetylase activity in hAT-MSCs is correlated with their passage number. miR-486-5p inhibits SIRT1 expression through a miR-486-5p binding site within the 3'-untranslated region of SIRT1. Overexpression of miR-486-5p inhibits SIRT1 deacetylase activity in hAT-MSCs, and transfection of miR-486-5p inhibitor shows the opposite effect. Downregulation of SIRT1 in hAT-MSCs induces senescence and inhibits cell proliferation. Exposure to high glucose increases miR-486-5p expression and inhibits SIRT1 expression in hAT-MSCs. Our data pinpoint miR-486-5p as an endogenous inhibitor of SIRT1 that promotes hAT-MSCs senescence and is potentially applicable to therapeutic manipulation of hAT-MSCs dysfunction in metabolic disorders.
