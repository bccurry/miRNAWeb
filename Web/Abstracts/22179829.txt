MicroRNA-133b is a key promoter of cervical carcinoma development through the activation of the ERK and AKT1 pathways. We report that elevated microRNA-133b (miR-133b) acts as an oncogene in human cervical carcinoma to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. In situ hybridization confirmed that miR-133b is localized in proliferating human cervical carcinoma cells with levels progressively elevating throughout advancing stages. Cellular studies showed that miR-133b enhances cell proliferation and colony formation by targeting mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 2 (MST2), cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42) and ras homolog gene family member A (RHOA), which subsequently results in activation of the tumorigenic protein kinase B alpha (AKT1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1 and ERK2, here abbreviated as ERK) signaling pathways. Mouse experiments revealed that upregulation of miR-133b in cervical carcinoma cells strongly promotes both in vivo tumorigenesis and independent metastasis to the mouse lung. The data indicates that upregulation of miR-133b shortens the latency of cervical carcinoma. Together, these findings suggest that miR-133b could be a potent marker for the early onset of cervical carcinoma.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 December 2011; doi:10.1038/onc.2011.561.
