MiR-125a/b regulates the activation of cancer stem cells in paclitaxel-resistant colon cancer. In this study, we investigated ALDH1A3, Mcl1, and miR-125a/b expression in HT29 cells and the effect of miR-125a/b on ALDH1A3 and Mcl1 expression. Our results showed that low expression of miR-125a/b and high expression of ALDH1A3 and Mel1 were observed in both ALDH1-positive HT29 and HT29-taxol cells. Overexpression of miR-125a/b significantly inhibited ALDH1A3 and Mcl1 expression, reduced cell survival, and increased cell apoptosis in HT29-taxol cells. Injection of miR-125a/b expression vector inhibited tumor growth in xenograft HT29-taxol mouse model. The current study suggested that miR-125a/b expression plays a key role in chemoresistance through upregulating ALDH1A3 and Mcl1 gene expression.
