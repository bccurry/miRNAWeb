Targeting Smad4 links microRNA-146a to the TGF-beta pathway during retinoid acid induction in acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line. The expression pattern of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their potential target genes were investigated in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line NB4 cells during all-trans-retinoid acid (ATRA) treatment by using a miRNA microarrays platform and real-time quantitative PCR (RTQ-PCR). MiR-146a as one of the miRNAs down-regulated by ATRA during APL differentiation was identified. Direct interaction between miR146a and its predictive target gene Smad4 were confirmed by Luciferase assay. Down-regulation of miR-146a and upregulation of Smad4 at protein levels were demonstrated. These data suggested that miR-146a might influence proliferation of APL cells through TGF-beta1/Smad signal transduction pathway during ATRA induction.
