Physiological identification of human transcripts translationally regulated by a specific microRNA. One mechanism by which endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) function is to suppress translation of target mRNAs. Computational identification of target mRNAs is hampered by the partial complementarity between miRNAs and their targets and the lack of in vivo approaches to identify targets. Here, we identify mRNAs that are regulated by specific endogenous miRNA by detecting shifts in individual mRNA abundance in polyribosome profiles following miRNA knockdown via siRNA. We have identified human genes whose mRNAs were found at significantly increased levels in the heavy polyribosome fractions following miRNA miR-30a-3p knockdown. If antibody was available, targets showed an increase in protein levels following the miRNA knockdown and a decrease following the miRNA overexpression. Although all identified transcripts have sequences that partially complement miR-30a-3p, none was identified by commonly used computational means. These data suggest that the functional interaction between miRNAs and mRNA targets is more complex than previously realized and describe an approach to refine predictive algorithms.
