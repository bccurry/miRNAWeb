MicroRNA-26b is underexpressed in human breast cancer and induces cell apoptosis by targeting SLC7A11. MicroRNAs are widely dysregulated in various cancers and integrated into tumorigenic programs as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Here, we show that miR-26b, which is down-regulated in human breast cancer specimens and cell lines, impairs viability and triggers apoptosis of human breast cancer MCF7 cells. SLC7A11 is identified as a direct target of miR-26b and its expression is remarkably increased in both breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples. Furthermore, SLC7A11 silence mimics miR-26b-aroused viability impairment and apoptosis in MCF7 cells. Our studies reveal a protective role of miR-26b in the molecular etiology of human breast cancer by promoting apoptosis.
