MicroRNA-200b downregulates oxidation resistance 1 (Oxr1) expression in the retina of type 1 diabetes model. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to participate in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and are involved in multiple pathogenic processes. Here, we identified miRNA expression changes in the retinas of Akita mice, a genetic model of type 1 diabetes, and investigated the potential role of miRNA in diabetic retinopathy. Visual function of Akita and control mice was evaluated by electroretinography. MiRNA expression changes in the retinas of Akita mice were identified by miRNA-specific microarray and confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The potential downstream targets of identified miRNAs were predicted by bioinformatic analysis using web-based applications and confirmed by dual luciferase assay. The mRNA and protein changes of identified downstream targets were examined by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. MiRNA-specific microarray and qRT-PCR showed that miR-200b was upregulated significantly in the Akita mouse retina. Sequence analysis and luciferase assay identified oxidation resistance 1 (Oxr1) as a downstream target gene regulated by miR-200b. In a human Mller cell line, MIO-M1, transfection of a miR-200b mimic downregulated Oxr1 expression. Conversely, transfection of MIO-M1 with a miR-200b inhibitor resulted in upregulated Oxr1. Furthermore, overexpression of recombinant Oxr1 attenuated oxidative stress marker, nitration of cellular proteins, and ameliorated apoptosis induced by 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), an oxidative stressor. Similarly, transfection of a miR-200b inhibitor decreased, whereas transfection of miR-200b mimic increased the number of apoptotic cells following 4-HNE treatment. These results suggested that miR-200b-regulated Oxr1 potentially has a protective role in diabetic retinopathy.
