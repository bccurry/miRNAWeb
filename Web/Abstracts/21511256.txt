miR-146a is modulated in human endothelial cell with aging. BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the senescence of vascular endothelial cells has critical roles in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction such as atherosclerosis and thrombosis. MicroRNA (miR) are small non-coding RNAs that inhibit gene expression by binding to complementary sequences in the 3'UTR of their target mRNAs. MiRs modulate a variety of biological functions such as cell development, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. Moreover, several miRs involved in endothelial cell function have been identified. METHODS AND RESULTS: Through a microarray approach, we have identified a miR-146a that is progressively modulated in endothelial cells with aging. In young human umbilical vein endothelial cells, this miR is involved in a premature senescence-like phenotype through direct targeting of the NOX4 protein, implicated in cell senescence and aging. CONCLUSIONS AND GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Finding important factors that regulate endothelial cell senescence, like miR-146a, will help provide novel therapeutic strategies for vascular disorders.
