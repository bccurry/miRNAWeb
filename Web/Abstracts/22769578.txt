miR-449a regulates the chondrogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells through direct targeting of LEF-1. microRNAs are small, about seventeen to twenty-three nucleotides in length, molecule which acts as a translational regulator of its target gene. By binding to its target, microRNAs are known to either inhibit translation or induce degradation of its target. Despite the great interest laid upon microRNA, however, the exact targets of each individual microRNAs in different processes remain largely unknown. In this study, we have noticed that lymphoid enhancer binding factor - 1 (LEF-1) showed distinctive expression during chondrogenesis of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell, and sought to identify a novel microRNA targeting this gene. Through subsequent studies, we have identified for the first time to the best of our knowledge that one particular microRNA, namely miR-449a, recognizes and regulates the expression of LEF-1 in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner. In addition, we observed that the inhibition of LEF-1 via miR-449a led to subsequent repression of Sox 9, which is a well-established regulator of chondrogenesis. Collectively, this study demonstrated that miR-449a directly targets LEF-1, which, in turn, affects the expression of Sox 9 leading to ultimate regulation of proper differentiation and chondrogensis of human BMSCs.
