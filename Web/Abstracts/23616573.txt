Autoantibody induction by DNA-containing immune complexes requires HMGB1 with the TLR2/microRNA-155 pathway. Anti-dsDNA Ab is reported to be the central pathogenic autoantibody involved in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. However, the mechanisms involved in anti-dsDNA Ab production remain unclear. Recent evidence indicated that DNA-containing immune complexes (ICs) in circulation (termed &quot;circulating DNA-containing ICs&quot;), which are one of the hallmarks of SLE, might be involved in autoantibody production. In this study, we explored their potential role in anti-dsDNA Ab production and the underlying mechanisms in patients with SLE. We demonstrated that circulating DNA-containing ICs were able to induce anti-dsDNA Ab. Of note, HMGB1 in circulating DNA-containing ICs was crucial for anti-dsDNA Ab induction. The HMGB1 content of circulating DNA-containing ICs also correlated positively with anti-dsDNA Ab production in patients with SLE. Further, we revealed that the TLR2/MyD88/microRNA-155 (miR-155) pathway was pivotal for HMGB1 to confer anti-dsDNA Ab induction, and Ets-1 was a functional target of miR-155 in the induction of anti-dsDNA Ab by circulating DNA-containing ICs. Finally, we validated the expression of miR-155 and Ets-1 and their correlation with anti-dsDNA Ab production in patients with SLE. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the crucial role of HMGB1 in autoantibody production mediated by the TLR2/MyD88/miR-155/Ets-1 pathway. These findings identify a novel mechanism to account for the persistent production of anti-dsDNA Ab in SLE and a clue for developing a novel therapeutic strategy against SLE.
