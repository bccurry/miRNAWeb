MicroRNA-92a negatively regulates Toll-like receptor (TLR)-triggered inflammatory response in macrophages by targeting MKK4 kinase. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in the initiation of immune responses against invading pathogens. MicroRNAs have been shown to be important regulators of TLR signaling. In this study, we have found that the stimulation of multiple TLRs rapidly reduced the levels of microRNA-92a (miRNA-92a) and some other members of the miRNA-92a family in macrophages. miR-92a mimics significantly decreased, whereas miR-92a knockdown increased, the activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway and the production of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages when stimulated with ligands for TLR4. Furthermore, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), a kinase that activates JNK/stress-activated protein kinase, was found to be directly targeted by miR-92a. Similar to the effects of the miR-92a mimics, knockdown of MKK4 inhibited the activation of JNK/c-Jun signaling and the production of TNF- and IL-6. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that TLR-mediated miR-92a reduction feedback enhances TLR-triggered production of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, thus outlining new mechanisms for fine-tuning the TLR-triggered inflammatory response.
