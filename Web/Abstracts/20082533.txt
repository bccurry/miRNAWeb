Downregulation of miR-21 enhances chemotherapeutic effect of taxol in breast carcinoma cells. The successful of anti-cancer treatment are often limited by the development of drug resistance. Recent work has highlighted the involvement of non-coding RNAs, microRNAs(miRNAs) in cancer development, and their possible involvement in the evolution of drug resistance has been proposed. In this study, we combine taxol chemotherapy and miR-21 inhibitor treatment via polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers vector to evaluate the effects of combination therapy on suppression of breast cancer cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for taxol were significantly decreased to a greater extent in the cells transfected with miR-21 inhibitor compared with cells treated with taxol alone. Taxol treatment also increased the percentage of apoptotic breast cancer cells in miR-21 inhibitor transfected cells compared with control cells. Furthermore, treatment of the miR-21 inhibitor-transfected cells with the anti-cancer drugs taxol resulted in significantly reduced cell viability and invasiveness compared with control cells. These results indicated that the miR-21 plays an important role in the resistance of breast carcinoma cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, miR-21 inhibitor gene therapy combined with taxol chemotherapy might represent a promising novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of breast malignancies.
