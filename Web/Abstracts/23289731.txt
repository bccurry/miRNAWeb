Differential regulation of inflammation by inflammatory mediators in cystic fibrosis lung epithelial cells. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which cause a massively proinflammatory phenotype in the CF airway. The chemical basis of the inflammation is hyperproduction of interleukin-8 (IL-8) by CF airway epithelial cells, based on both an intrinsic mutation-dependent mechanism and by infection. In infection-free, cultured CF lung epithelial cells, high levels of the microRNA (miR), miR-155, is responsible for hyperexpression of IL-8. However, whether infection-induced IL-8 expression in CF cells is also mediated by miR-155 is not known. We have hypothesized that miR-155 might be a general mediator of enhanced IL-8 expression in CF cells, either in response to other cytokine/chemokine mediators of inflammation, or after exposure to infectious agents. Here we find that a reduction in miR-155 accompanies suppression of IL-8 by either the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 or by inhibition of ambient IL-1 with a neutralizing antibody. However, attempts to elevate IL-8 levels with either intact bacteria [viz. a mucoid strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)], or lipopolysaccharide were unable to elevate miR-155 above its intrinsically high level in the absence of these agents. Instead, in response to PA infection, the CF cells modestly suppress the expression of miR-155, and express a novel set of miRs, including miR-215. We find that ex vivo CF lung epithelial cells also express high levels of both miR-155 and miR-215. The predicted module of infection-induced mRNA targets focuses on activation of the NFB-signaling pathway, and on the proapoptotic p53-signaling pathway. We interpret these data to suggest that that CF lung epithelial cells respond to PA or bacterial cell products with a novel miR program that may carry with it serious challenges to survival.
