p53 enters the microRNA world. Recently, microRNAs, which are regulated by the transcription factor encoded by the tumor suppressor gene p53, were identified independently by seven groups. Their studies highlight the microRNAs miR-34a and miR-34b/c as direct, conserved p53 target genes that presumably mediate induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence by p53. Since these microRNAs may regulate the levels of hundreds of different proteins, these findings add a new, challenging layer of complexity to the p53 network. The initial evidence suggesting that miR-34 genes are central mediators of p53 function is summarized here.
