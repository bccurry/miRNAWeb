[Reduced expression of miR-218 and its significance in gastric cancer]. To investigate the expression and function of miR-218 in gastric cancer. miR-218 levels were evaluated in 20 non-cardia gastric cancer tissues using TaqMan stem-loop real-time PCR analysis. Pre-miR-218 and anti-miR-218 inhibitor were used to change the miR-218 expression level and examine its effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle and cell invasion. Comparing with the corresponding normal tissues, miR-218 expression was significantly reduced in the gastric cancer tissue (P &lt; 0.01). Forced expression of miR-218 increased apoptosis in AGS cells. The proportion of apoptosis cells induced by transfection of pre-miR-218 was greater than that induced by control (21.6% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.032). Pre-miR-218 resulted in a significantly decreased cell growth activity (P &lt; 0.01) and cell invasion (P &lt; 0.05) of AGS cells compared with that of the control. miR-218 expression is reduced in gastric cancer. miR-218 may function as a tumor suppressor in gastric carcinoma.
