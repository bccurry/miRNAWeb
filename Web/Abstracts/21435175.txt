MicroRNAs and glioblastoma: roles in core signalling pathways and potential clinical implications. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed small non-coding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Dysregulation of these molecules has been indicated in the development of many cancers. Altered expression levels of several miRNAs were identified also in glioblastoma. It was repeatedly found that miRNAs are involved in important signalling pathways, which play roles in crucial cellular processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, invasion, angiogenesis and stem cell behaviour. Therefore, miRNAs represent promising therapeutic targets in glioblastoma. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about miRNAs significance in glioblastoma, with special focus on their involvement in core signalling pathways, their roles in drug resistance and potential clinical implications.
