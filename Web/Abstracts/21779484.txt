MicroRNA-375 and MicroRNA-221: Potential Noncoding RNAs Associated with Antiproliferative Activity of Benzyl Isothiocyanate in Pancreatic Cancer. The deregulated presence or absence of microRNAs (miRNAs) might play an important role in molecular pathways leading to neoplastic transformation. At present, it is also thought that the approaches to interfere miRNA functions should be helpful for developing novel therapeutic opportunities for human cancer. In this study, we provide evidence that the anticancer agent benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) has the ability to modulate the level of miRNAs such as miR-221 and miR-375, known to be abnormally expressed in pancreatic cancer patients. Interestingly, ectopic expression of miR-375 or the enforced silencing of miR-221 in cultured pancreatic cancer cells attenuates cell viability and sensitizes antiproliferative action of BITC. We also show that the expression of putative tumor suppressor miR-375 is more abundant in nonpathological mice pancreata than those with Kras(G12D)-driven pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). To the contrary, the expression of oncogenic miR-221 is significantly elevated in the mouse pancreas with PanIN lesions. Although miR-375 has been shown to be aberrantly expressed in pancreatic cancer patients, there has not been a comprehensive study to investigate the molecular pathways targeted by this miRNA in pancreatic cancer cells. Further analysis by gene expression microarray revealed that IGFBP5 and CAV-1, potential biomarkers of pancreatic cancer, were significantly downregulated in cells transfected with miR-375. Correlatively, elevated expression of IGFBP5 and CAV-1 was evident in the mouse pancreas with preneoplastic lesions in which the expression of miR-375 wanes. Taken together, our findings suggest that anticancer agent BITC might target the expression of miR-221 and miR-375 to switch hyperproliferative pancreatic cancer cells to a hypoproliferative state.
