[Differential expression of miR-21, miR-126, miR-143, miR-373 in normal cervical tissue, cervical cancer tissue and Hela cell]. To investigate the differential expression of miR-21, miR-126, miR-143 and miR-373 in normal cervical tissue, cervical cancer tissue and Hela cell. The expressions of miR-21, miR-126, miR-143 and miR-373 were detected by real-time PCR in cervical cancer tissue, cervical tissue of benign uterine tumor and Hela cell. High expression of miR-21 was observed in cervical cancer and Hela cell, while low expression was observed in normal cervical tissue. The relative quantification of miR-21 in cerveical cancer was 11.3196 times that of miR-21 in normal cervical tissue (P &lt; 0.05). The expression levels of miR-143 and miR-373 in cervical cancer and Hela cell were lower than those of normal cervical tissue. The relative quantification of miR-143 in cerveical cancer was 0.1553 times that of normal cervical tissue (P &lt; 0.05), and the relative quantification of miR-373 in cerveical cancer was 0.4907 times that of normal cervical tissue (P &lt; 0.05). The expression of miR-126 had no significant difference among cervical cancer tissue, Hela cell and normal cervical tissue (P &gt; 0.05). miRNAs are closely related to the occurrence and regulation of cervical cancer. The high expression of miR-21 in cervical cancer and Hela cell indicate that it may play a possible role of oncogenes, while miR-143 and miR-373 with low expression may play the role of tumor suppressor genes.
