Post-transcriptional Regulation of CFTR Expression and Function by MicroRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and changes in their actions can contribute to disease states. Little is understood regarding miRNA functions in the airway epithelium under normal or diseased conditions. We profiled miRNA expression in well-differentiated primary cultures of human cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF airway epithelia, and discovered that miR-509-3p and miR-494 levels were increased in CF epithelia. Human airway epithelia transfected with the mimics of miR-509-3p or -494 showed decreased CFTR expression, while their respective anti-miRs had the opposite effect. Interestingly, the two miRNAs acted cooperatively in regulating CFTR expression. Upon infecting airway epithelial cells with S. aureus or stimulating with the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF or IL-1, we observed increased expression of both miRNAs and a concurrent decrease in CFTR expression and function, suggesting that inflammatory mediators might regulate these miRNAs. Transfecting epithelia with anti-miRs for miRs-509-3p and -494 or inhibiting NF-B signaling before stimulating cells with TNF or IL-1 suppressed these responses, suggesting that expression of both miRNAs was responsive to NF-B signaling. Thus, miRs-509-3p and -494 are dynamic regulators of CFTR abundance and function in the airway epithelium.
