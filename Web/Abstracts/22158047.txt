microRNA-107 functions as a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by downregulation of protein kinase C Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most prevalent cancer worldwide with about 600000 new cases diagnosed each year. Understanding the molecular pathways that lead to HNSCC is crucial to identify new targets for anti-cancer drug development. Protein kinase C (PKC) is elevated in HNSCC and regulates the activation of Akt, Stat3 and Rho GTPases. To date, the molecular mechanism of PKC dysregulation in HNSCC remains to be elucidated. In silico analysis identified three putative microRNA-107 (miR-107) binding sites in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of PKC. An inverse relationship was revealed between miR-107 and PKC in HNSCC cell lines. Delivery of miR-107 reduced PKC levels in SCC15, SCC25 and CAL27, three HNSCC cell lines with high PKC and low miR-107. The activity of a luciferase reporter construct containing the 3'-UTR of PKC was downregulated by miR-107 and mutations in the three cognate miR-107 binding sites completely ablated the regulation by miR-107. Treatment with miR-107 significantly blocked cell proliferation, DNA replication, colony formation and invasion in SCC25 and CAL27 cells. Ectopic expression of miR-resistant PKC was sufficient to partially rescue the loss-of-function phenotype in miR-107-overexpressing SCC25 cells. Tumor growth in nude mice was retarded by 937% in CAL27/miR-107 cells compared with CAL27/miR-control cells. Last, human primary HNSCC tumors with elevated PKC had reduced miR-107 expression. Our results demonstrate that PKC is directly regulated by miR-107 and, moreover, suggest that miR-107 may be a potential anti-cancer therapeutic for HNSCC.Oncogene advance online publication, 12 December 2011; doi:10.1038/onc.2011.565.
