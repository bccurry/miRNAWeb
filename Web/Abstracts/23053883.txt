Effect of miR-451 on the biological behavior of the esophageal carcinoma cell line EC9706. MicroRNAs play important roles in coordinating a variety of cellular processes. Abnormal expression of miRNAs has been linked to several cancers. However, the functional role of miR-451 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma remains unclear. The present study explored the effects of miR-451 on the biological behavior of the esophageal carcinoma cell line EC9706. Synthetic miR-451 mimics were transfected into EC9706 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The expression of miR-451 was analyzed by RT-PCR and the expressions of Bcl-2, AKT and phosphorylated AKT were analyzed by Western blotting. The MTT assay, soft agar colony formation assay, transwell assay and FACS were used to assess the effect of miR-451 on EC9706 cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis and apoptosis. Tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous inoculation of cells into BALB/c nude mice. In comparison to the controls, a significant increase in the expression of miR-451 was associated with significantly decreased expressions of Bcl-2, AKT and p-AKT, and a significant increase in the apoptosis rate. The number of cell clones was significantly decreased by miR-451 expression, which also caused the inhibition of cell proliferation. The average number of cells penetrating the matrigel was significantly lower than the controls. Injection of miR-451 inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft model. Upregulated expression of miR-451 induced apoptosis and suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis in the esophageal carcinoma cell line EC9706. In addition, injection of miR-451 inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft model of esophageal cancer.
