miR-335 Inhibits Small Cell Lung Cancer Bone Metastases via IGF-1R and RANKL Pathways. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly progressing, incurable cancer that frequently spreads to bone. New insights are needed to identify therapeutic targets to prevent or retard SCLC metastatic progression. Human SCLC SBC-5 cells in mouse xenograft models home to skeletal and non-skeletal sites while human SCLC SBC-3 cells only pervade non-skeletal sites. Because microRNAs (miRNAs) often act as tumor-regulators, we investigated their role in preclinical models of SCLC. miRNA expression profiling revealed selective and reduced expression of miR-335 and miR-29a in SBC-5 cells, compared to SBC-3 cells. In SBC-5 cells, miR-335 expression correlated with bone osteolytic lesions while miR-29a expression did not. Over-expression of miR-335 in SBC-5 cells significantly reduced cell migration, invasion, proliferation, colony formation, and osteoclast induction in vitro. Importantly, in miR-335 over-expressing SBC-5 cell xenografts (n=10), there were minimal osteolytic lesions in the majority of mice and none in three mice. Expression of RANKL and IGF-1R, key mediators of bone metastases, were elevated in SBC-5 as compared to SBC-3 cells. Mechanistically, over-expression of miR-335 in SBC-5 cells reduced RANKL and IGF-1R expression. In conclusion, loss of miR-335 promoted SCLC metastatic skeletal lesions via de-regulation of IGF-1R and RANKL pathways and was associated with metastatic osteolytic skeletal lesions. These preclinical findings establish a need to pursue the role of miR-335 in human SCLC with metastatic skeletal disease.
