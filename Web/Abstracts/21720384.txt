The miR 302-367 cluster drastically affects self-renewal and infiltration properties of glioma-initiating cells through CXCR4 repression and consequent disruption of the SHH-GLI-NANOG network. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common form of primary brain tumor in adults, often characterized by poor survival. Glioma-initiating cells (GiCs) are defined by their extensive self-renewal, differentiation, and tumor initiation properties. GiCs are known to be involved in tumor growth and recurrence, and in resistance to conventional treatments. One strategy to efficiently target GiCs in GBM consists in suppressing their stemness and consequently their tumorigenic properties. In this study, we show that the miR-302-367 cluster is strongly induced during serum-mediated stemness suppression. Stable miR-302-367 cluster expression is sufficient to suppress the stemness signature, self-renewal, and cell infiltration within a host brain tissue, through inhibition of the CXCR4 pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of CXCR4 leads to the disruption of the sonic hedgehog (SHH)-GLI-NANOG network, which is involved in self-renewal and expression of the embryonic stem cell-like signature. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the miR-302-367 cluster is able to efficiently trigger a cascade of inhibitory events leading to the disruption of GiCs stem-like and tumorigenic properties.
