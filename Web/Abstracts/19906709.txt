Integrative analysis of the human cis-antisense gene pairs, miRNAs and their transcription regulation patterns. Cis-antisense gene pairs (CASGPs) can transcribe mRNAs from an opposite strand of a given locus. To classify and understand diverse CASGP phenomena in the human we compiled a genome-wide catalog of CASGPs and integrated these sequences with microarray, SAGE and miRNA data. Using the concept of overlapping regions and clustering of SA transcripts by chromosome coordinates, we identified up to 9000 overlapping antisense loci. Four thousand three hundred and seventy-four of these CASGPs form 1759 complex gene architectures. We found that approximately 35% (6347/18160) of RefSeq genes are overlapped with the antisense transcripts. About 30% of Affymetrix U133 microarray initial sequences map transcripts of approximately 35% CASGPs and reveal mostly concordant expression in CASGPs. We found strong significant overrepresentation of human miRNA genes in loci of CASGPs. We developed a data-driven model of cross-talk between co-expressed CASGPs and DICER1-mediated miRNA pathway in normal spermatogenesis and in severe teratozoospermia. Specifically, we revealed complex SA structural-functional gene module composing the protein-coding genes, WDR6, DALRD3, NDUFAF3 and ncRNA precursors, mir-425 and mir-191, which could provide downregulation of ncRNA pathway via direct targeting DICER1 and basonuclin 2 transcripts by mir-425 and mir-191 in normal spermatogenesis, but this mechanism is switched off in severe teratozoospermia.
