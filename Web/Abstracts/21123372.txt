Insertion of microRNA targets into the flavivirus genome alters its highly neurovirulent phenotype. Flaviviruses such as West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses are important neurotropic human pathogens, causing a devastating and often fatal neuroinfection. Here, we demonstrate that incorporation into the viral genome of a target sequence for cellular microRNAs expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) enables alteration of the neurovirulence of the virus and control of the neuropathogenesis of flavivirus infection. As a model virus for this type of modification, we used a neurovirulent chimeric tick-borne encephalitis/dengue virus (TBEV/DEN4) that contained the structural protein genes of a highly pathogenic TBEV. The inclusion of just a single target copy for a brain tissue-expressed mir-9, mir-124a, mir-128a, mir-218, or let-7c microRNA into the TBEV/DEN4 genome was sufficient to prevent the development of otherwise lethal encephalitis in mice infected intracerebrally with a large dose of virus. Viruses bearing a complementary target for mir-9 or mir-124a were highly restricted in replication in primary neuronal cells, had limited access into the CNS of immunodeficient mice, and retained the ability to induce a strong humoral immune response in monkeys. This work suggests that microRNA targeting to control flavivirus tissue tropism and pathogenesis might represent a rational approach for virus attenuation and vaccine development.
