MicroRNA-24 targeting RNA-binding protein DND1 in tongue squamous cell carcinoma. Deregulations of microRNA have been frequently observed in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), but their roles in tumorigenesis are not entirely clear. Here, we reported the up-regulation of miR-24 in TSCC. MiR-24 up-regulation reduced the expression of RNA-binding protein dead end 1 (DND1). Knockdown of miR-24 led to enhanced expression of DND1. The direct targeting of miR-24 to the DND1 mRNA was predicted bioinformatically and confirmed by luciferase reporter gene assays. Furthermore, the miR-24-mediated change in DND1 expression suppressed the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B), and also led to enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis in TSCC cells.
