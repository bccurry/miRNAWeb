[miR-126 modulates the expression of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro]. To investigate the regulatory effect of miR-126 on epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) in ECV-304 cells. The miR-126-expressing plasmid targeting EGFL7 (plegfp-N1-miR-126) was constructed and transiently transfected into ECV-304 cells via liposome. The changes in the mRNA and protein expressions of EGFL7 in the transfected cells were analyzed by fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. Transfection with the recombinant plasmid plegfp-N1/miR-126 resulted in decreased EGFL7 expression with the passage of time, and the expression reached the lowest level at 48 h after the transfection. The expression of EGFL7 protein was reduced by 67% following the transfection in comparison with the control level, while the transfection with the empty vector resulted in a reduction only by 6.5% relative to the control level. miR-126 can downregulate EGFL7 expression at the protein level in ECV-304 cells.
