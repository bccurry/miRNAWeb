PDGF induced microRNA alterations in cancer cells. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) regulates gene transcription by binding to specific receptors. PDGF plays a critical role in oncogenesis in brain and other tumors, regulates angiogenesis, and remodels the stroma in physiologic conditions. Here, we show by using microRNA (miR) arrays that PDGFs regulate the expression and function of miRs in glioblastoma and ovarian cancer cells. The two PDGF ligands AA and BB affect expression of several miRs in ligand-specific manner; the most robust changes consisting of let-7d repression by PDGF-AA and miR-146b induction by PDGF-BB. Induction of miR-146b by PDGF-BB is modulated via MAPK-dependent induction of c-fos. We demonstrate that PDGF regulates expression of some of its known targets (e.g. cyclin D1) through miR alterations and identify the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a new PDGF-BB target. We show that its expression and function are repressed by PDGF-induced miR-146b and that mir-146b and EGFR correlate inversely in human glioblastomas. We propose that PDGF-regulated gene transcription involves alterations in non-coding RNAs and provide evidence for a miR-dependent feedback mechanism balancing growth factor receptor signaling in cancer cells.
