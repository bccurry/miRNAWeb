The clinical characteristics and prognostic significance of MN1 gene and MN1-associated microRNA expression in adult patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. This study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics and prognostic significance of the meningioma 1 (MN1) gene and MN1-associated microRNA expression in Chinese adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The expression level of MN1, microRNA-20 (miR-20a), and microRNA-181b (miR-181b) in bone marrow mononuclear cells was measured in 158 newly diagnosed AML patients and 20 cases of normal healthy donors by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. All AML patients significantly overexpressed MN1 at the level of 0.01983 (P&lt;0.001) compared with normal controls. High MN1 expression was associated with spleen involvement (P=0.037), NPM1 wild type (P=0.001), lower miR-20a expression levels (P=0.015), and higher miR-181b expression levels (P=0.035). MiR-20a (P=0.029) and miR-181b (P=0.017) overexpressed in the bone marrow cells of patients with certain subtypes of AML compared with healthy donors. High MN1 expressers had lower complete remission (CR) rates and shorter overall survival (OS) within the Southwest Oncology Group classification. In multivariable models, high MN1 expression was associated with worse CR rates (P=0.01), relapse-free survival (RFS; P=0.02), and OS (P=0.02); high miR-20a expression was associated with higher CR rates (P=0.008) and longer OS (P=0.04), whereas high miR-181b expression was associated with lower CR rates (P=0.03), and shorter RFS (P=0.045) and OS (P=0.017). High MN1 expression confers worse prognosis in Chinese adult patients with de novo AML. MN1 gene and MN1-associated microRNAs provide clinical prognosis of AML patients and may refine their molecular risk classification.
