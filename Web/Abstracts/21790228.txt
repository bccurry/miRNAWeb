Expression of miR-143 reduces growth and migration of human bladder carcinoma cells by targeting cyclooxygenase-2. Systemic chemotherapy is the only current modality that provides the potential for long-term survival in bladder carcinoma patients with metastatic disease. Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 induces expression of immune- and cell proliferation-related genes and is associated with the grade, prognosis and recurrence of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. There is abundant evidence that aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is implicated in numerous disease states and miRNAs have the potential to be used for cancer therapeutics. Here, we found expression of miR-143 to be low in a series of human bladder carcinomas as compared to background tissue. In addition, restoration of miR-143 by cell transfection in T24 cancer cells led to decreased COX-2 expression, reduced proliferation and mobility. Our findings will help to further understand the functions of miRNAs in cancer cells and point to a specific potential of miR-143 may be employed as a therapeutic agent for bladder carcinoma. The results provide insights into the development of novel tumor markers or new therapeutic strategies.
