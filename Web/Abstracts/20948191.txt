IFN- and TNF- synergistically induce microRNA-155 which regulates TAB2/IP-10 expression in human mesangial cells. MicroRNAs are noncoding small RNA molecules that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression. microRNA-155 (miR-155), one of the microRNAs, is involved in the control of various genes. However, the role of miR-155 in inflammatory responses in mesangial cells is not known. In the present study, we examined the expression of miR-155 in mesangial cells. The expression of miR-155 in cultured normal human mesangial cells treated with interferon- (IFN-) and/or tumor-necrosis factor- (TNF-) was examined. The cells were transfected with miR-155 mimic, siRNA against transforming growth factor--activated kinase-1 (TAK1)-binding protein 2 (TAB2) or siRNA against nuclear factor-B (NF-B). IFN- and TNF- synergistically induced the expression of miR-155. Transfection of cells with miR-155 mimic inhibited the expression of TAB2 and IFN--inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10). The expression of IP-10 was suppressed by knockdown of TAB2. Induction of miR-155 was inhibited by RNA interference against TAB2 or NF-B. Combined stimulation with IFN- and TNF- induces miR-155 via TAB2 and NF-B. miR-155 negatively regulates TAB2, as a negative feedback system, to lower IP-10 expression. miR-155 may play a role in the regulation of inflammatory and immune reactions in the kidney.
