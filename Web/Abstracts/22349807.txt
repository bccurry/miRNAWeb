Aberrant microRNAs expression in CD133/CD326 human lung adenocarcinoma initiating cells from A549. Increasing evidence demonstrates that miRNAs are involved in the dysregulation of tumor initiating cells (TICs) in various tumors. Due to a lack of definitive markers, cell sorting is not an ideal separation method for lung adenocarcinoma initiating cells. In this study, we combined paclitaxel with serum-free medium cultivation (inverse-induction) to enrich TICs from A549 cells, marked by CD133/CD326, defined features of stemness. We next investigated aberrant microRNAs in this subpopulation compared to normal cells with miRNA microarray and found that 50 miRNAs exhibited a greater than 2-fold change in expression. As further validation, 10 miRNAs were chosen to perform quantitative RT-PCR on the A549 cell line and primary samples. The results suggest that aberrant expression of miRNAs such as miR-29ab, miR-183, miR-17-5p and miR-127-3P may play an important role in regulating the bio-behavior of TICs.
