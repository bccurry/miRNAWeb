17-estradiol up-regulates miR-155 expression and reduces TP53INP1 expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In estrogen responsive breast cancer cells, estradiol (E2) is a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. MiR-155 has emerged as an &quot;oncomiR&quot;, which is the most significantly up-regulated miRNA in breast cancer. Moreover, miR-155 is higher in ER (+) breast tumors than ER (-), but no one has examined whether E2 regulates miR-155 expression in MCF-7 cells. In this study, the aim was to explore whether miR-155 involved in E2 regulated expression of estrogen responsive genes. We evaluated miR-155 expression in human breast cancer cells by real-time PCR, finding out miR-155 was overexpressed in MCF-7 cells compared with MDA-MB-231 cells. Treatment with E2 in MCF-7 cells increased miR-155 expression, promoting proliferation and decreasing apoptosis, similarly, transfection of miR-155m to MCF-7 cells gave the similar results. In contrast, inhibited miR-155 expression by transfection with miR-155 inhibitors reduced proliferation and promoted apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Moreover, TP53INP1 is one of the targets of miR-155. E2 negatively regulated TP53INP1 mRNA expression and the protein expression of TP53INP1, cleaved-caspase-3, -8, -9, and p21, whereas transfection with miR-155 inhibitors increased TP53INP1, cleaved-caspase-3, -8, -9, and p21 protein level. These results demonstrated that E2 promoted breast cancer development and progression possibly through increasing the expression of miR-155, which was overexpressed in MCF-7 cells, contributes to proliferation of MCF-7 cells possibly through down-regulating TP53INP1.
