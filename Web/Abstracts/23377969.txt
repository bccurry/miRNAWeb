The p53/microRNA network in cancer: experimental and bioinformatics approaches. In the recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified as important components of the signaling cascades that mediate and regulate tumor suppression exerted by p53. This review illustrates some of the main principles that underlie the mechanisms by which miRNAs participate in p53's function and how they were identified. Furthermore, the current status of the research on the connection between p53 and miRNAs, as well as alterations in the p53/miRNA pathways found in cancer will be summarized and discussed. In addition, experimental and bioinformatics approaches, which can be applied to study the connection between p53 and miRNAs are described. Although, some of the central miRNA-encoding genes that mediate the effects of p53, such as the miR-34 and miR-200 families, have been identified, many additional analyses remain to be performed to fully elucidate the connections between p53 and miRNAs.
