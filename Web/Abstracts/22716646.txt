microRNA-29b contributes to pre-eclampsia through its effects on apoptosis, invasion and angiogenesis of trophoblast cells. PE (pre-eclampsia), a pregnancy-specific disorder, is characterized by increased trophoblast cell death and deficient trophoblast invasion and reduced trophoblast-mediated remodelling of spiral arteries. The present study was performed to determine the function of miR-29b (microRNA-29b) in trophoblast cells and its underlying role in the pathogenesis of PE. The prediction of miR-29b target genes was performed using computer-based programs, including Targetscan, Pictar and miRBase. The function of these target genes was analysed further by gene ontology (GO). The effects of miR-29b on apoptosis, and invasion and angiogenesis of trophoblast cell lines (HTR-8/SVneo, BeWo and JAR) were examined by flow cytometry and Matrigel assay respectively. We found that miR-29b induced apoptosis and inhibited invasion and angiogenesis of trophoblast cells. Further studies confirmed that miR-29b regulated the expression of MCL1 (myeloid cell leukaemia sequence 1), MMP2 (encoding matrix metallproteinase 2), VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A) and ITGB1 (integrin 1) genes by directly binding to their 3'-UTRs (untranslated regions). Moreover, we identified that there was an inverse correlation between miR-29b and its target genes in subjects with PE. Taken together, these findings support a novel role for miR-29b in invasion, apoptosis and angiogenesis of trophoblast cells, and miR-29b may become a new potential therapeutic target for PE.
