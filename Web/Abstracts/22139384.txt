miR-24 functions as a tumor suppressor in Hep2 laryngeal carcinoma cells partly through down-regulation of the S100A8 protein. microRNAs, a family of small non-coding RNAs, regulating approximately 30% of all human genes are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of several types of cancers, including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Here, we demonstrate that miR-24 is down-regulated in human LSCC tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-24 in Hep2 cells significantly induced cell morphology changes and inhibited cell proliferation and invasion ability in vitro by targeting S100A8 at the translational level. Meanwhile, miR-24 could significantly inhibit Hep2 cell invasion after S100A8 protein blockade. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-24 may function as a tumor suppressor in LSCC through down-regulation of S100A8, which suggests that miR-24 could serve as a novel potential maker for LSCC therapy.
