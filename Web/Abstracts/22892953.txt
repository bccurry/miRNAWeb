Myotonic dystrophy: is a narrow focus obscuring the rest of the field? The myotonic dystrophies (DM1 and DM2) are the paradigm for RNA toxicity in disease pathogenesis. The emphasis of this review will be on recent developments and issues in understanding the pathogenesis of DM1 and how this is driving the accelerated pace of translational and therapeutic developments. RNA toxicity in myotonic dystrophy is now associated with bi-directional antisense transcription, dysregulation of microRNAs and potentially non-ATG-mediated translation of homopolymeric toxic proteins. The role of other RNA-binding proteins beyond MBNL1 and CUGBP1, such as Staufen 1 and DDX5, are being identified and studied with respect to their role in myotonic dystrophy. New functions for MBNL1 in miR-1 biogenesis might have a clinically relevant role in myotonic dystrophy cardiac conduction defects and pathology. Advances are being made in identifying and characterizing small molecules with the potential to disrupt CUG-MBNL1 interactions. Mechanisms of RNA toxicity are moving beyond a simplistic 'foci-centric' view of DM1 pathogenesis as a spliceopathy due to MBNL1 sequestration. Therapeutic development for myotonic dystrophy is moving rapidly with the development of antisense and small molecule therapies. Clinically, significant emphasis is being placed on biomarker discovery and outcome measures as an essential prelude to clinical trials.
