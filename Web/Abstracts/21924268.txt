miRNA-1 targets fibronectin1 and suppresses the migration and invasion of the HEp2 laryngeal squamous carcinoma cell line. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an evolutionarily conserved class of endogenous, non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and are involved in tumorigenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that miR-1 suppresses the potential for growth, migration and invasion in the HEp2 cell line. Furthermore, we validate that FN1 is a direct target gene for miR-1 via fluorescent reporter assay and is negatively regulated by miR-1. Moreover, the knockdown of FN1 has the same phenotypic effects as the overexpression of miR-1. Taken together, our results provide evidence that miR-1 may play a role as a tumor suppressor gene in laryngeal carcinoma.
