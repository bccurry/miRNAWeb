Suppression of latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 restores growth inhibitory TGF-beta signaling through microRNAs. Cancer cells secreting excess latent TGF- are often resistant to TGF- induced growth inhibition. We observed that RNAi against TGF-1 led to apoptotic death in such cell lines with features that were, paradoxically, reminiscent of TGF- signaling activity and that included transiently enhanced SMAD2 and AKT phosphorylation. A comprehensive search in Hela cells for potential microRNA drivers of this mechanism revealed that RNAi against TGF-1 led to induction of pro-apoptotic miR-34a and to a globally decreased oncomir expression. The reduced levels of the oncomirs miR-18a and miR-24 accounted for the observed derepression of two TGF-1 processing factors, thrombospondin-1, and furin, respectively. Our data suggest a novel mechanism in which latent TGF-1, thrombospondin 1, and furin form a microRNA-mediated regulatory feedback loop. For cells with high levels of latent TGF-, this provides a potentially widespread mechanism of escape from TGF--mediated growth arrest at the earliest point in the signaling pathway, TGF- processing.
