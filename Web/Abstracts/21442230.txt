Prediction of conserved microRNAs from skin and mucosal human papillomaviruses. Eight human papillomavirus (HPV) types including four cutaneous HPV types (HPV-5, HPV-8, HPV-20 and HPV-38) and four mucosal HPV types (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16 and HPV-18) were selected for this miRNA study. Pre-miRNAs were predicted using a computer programme, and the conserved mature miRNAs were compared to currently known miRNAs. Predicted HPV miRNAs related to miR-466, -467 and -669 were common and specific to the mucosal HPV types. Northern blot hybridization confirmed a predicted miRNA in HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines encoded by mucosal HPVs. HPV-38 was predicted to express an miRNA conserved to human let-7a and the expression of let-7a, in HPV-38-positive non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) biopsies was 10-fold higher than those with HPV-positive (for other types except HPV-38) and HPV-negative NMSCs, suggesting that let-7a expression might be related to HPV-38 infection. Potential gene targets of the predicted miRNA that may aid HPV in infection and pathogenesis were also analysed.
