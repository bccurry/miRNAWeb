MicroRNA biogenesis and regulation of bone remodeling. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. This review will highlight our current understanding of miRNA biogenesis and mechanisms of action, and will summarize recent work on the role of miRNAs, including the miR-29 family, in bone remodeling. These studies represent the first steps in demonstrating the importance of miRNAs in the control of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function. An in-depth understanding of the roles of these regulatory RNAs in the skeleton will be critical for the development of new therapeutics aimed at treating bone loss and perhaps facilitating fracture repair.
