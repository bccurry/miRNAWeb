Sequence context outside the target region influences the effectiveness of miR-223 target sites in the RhoB 3'UTR. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-22 nucleotide regulatory small RNAs that repress message translation via base-pairing with complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of targeted transcripts. To date, it is still difficult to find a true miRNA target due to lack of a clear understanding of how miRNAs functionally interact with their targeted transcripts for efficient repression. Previous studies have shown that nucleotides 2 to 7 at the 5'-end of a mature miRNA, the 'seed sequence', can nucleate miRNA/target interactions. In the current study, we have validated that the RhoB mRNA is a bona fide miR-223 target. We have analyzed the functional activities of two miR223-binding sites within the RhoB 3'UTR. We find that the two miR-223 target sites in the RhoB 3'UTR contribute differentially to the total repression of RhoB translation. Moreover, we demonstrate that some AU-rich motifs located upstream of the distal miRNA-binding site enhance miRNA function, independent of the miRNA target sequences being tested. We also demonstrate that the AU-rich sequence elements are polar, and do not affect the activities of miRNAs whose sites lie upstream of these elements. These studies provide further support for the role of sequences outside of miRNA target region influencing miRNA function.
