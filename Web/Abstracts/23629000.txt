Electrochemical determination of microRNA-21 based on bio bar code and hemin/G-quadruplet DNAenzyme. A simple and novel microRNA (miRNA) biosensor was developed using DNA-Au bio bar code (DNA-Au) and G-quadruplex-based DNAenzyme. DNA-Au increased the amount of miRNA-21 participating in hybridization. Hemin/G-quadruplex DNAenzyme significantly improved the catalysis of H(2)O(2) by oxidation of hydroquinone, resulting in an obvious reduction current of benzoquinone for miRNA-21 indirect detection. Under optimum conditions, the linear relationship between miRNA-21 concentration and reduction response was obtained with the detection limit of 0.006 pM, which showed a good sensitivity. Besides, selectivity of the biosensor was investigated by detecting the base mismatched miRNAs. This proposed method was further applied to detect miRNA-21 extracted from human hepatocarcinoma BEL-7402 cells and human mastocarcinoma MCF-7 cells. The influence of bisphenol A (BPA) on the expression of miRNA-21 in cells was also investigated. The biosensor performs well in practical applications, which suggests it may provide a new platform for gene diagnosis.
