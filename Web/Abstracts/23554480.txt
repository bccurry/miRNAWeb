HIV-1 Tat C modulates expression of miRNA-101 to suppress VE-cadherin in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. HIV-1 infection leads to the development of HIV-associated neurological disorders. The HIV-1 Tat protein has been reported to exert an adverse effect on blood-brain barrier integrity and permeability. Perturbation in permeability is mainly caused by disruptions in adherens junctions and tight junction proteins. We have identified HIV-1 Tat C-induced disruption of VE-cadherin mediated by miRNA-101 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs). HIV-1 Tat C increased the expression of miR-101, which led to downregulation of VE-cadherin. Overexpression of miR-101 resulted into the suppression of VE-cadherin. Inhibition of miR-101 by the miRNA inhibitor enhanced the expression of VE-cadherin. We have demonstrated that VE-cadherin is a direct target of miR-101 using a luciferase reporter assay, which showed that mutated VE-cadherin 3'UTR and miR-101 cotransfection did not change luciferase activity. By overexpression and knockdown of miR-101, we have demonstrated that the expression level of claudin-5 is governed by the expression of VE-cadherin. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism for the regulation of barrier permeability by miR-101 via posttranscriptional regulation of VE-cadherin in human BMVECs exposed to the HIV-1 Tat C protein.
