Biogenesis of MiRNA-195 and its role in biogenesis, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. microRNA-195(miR-195) is an important member of the micro-15/16/195/424/497 family, and which is activated in multiple diseases, such as cancers, heart failure, and schizophrenia. Mir-195 regulates a plethora of target proteins, which are involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis, proliferation. WEE1, CDK6, and Bcl-2 are confirmed target genes of miR-195 that are involved in miR-195-mediated cell-cycle and apoptosis effects. However, the mechanism of miR-195 action is not completely understood. This review summarizes recent the research progress regarding the roles of miR-195 in the cell cycle and in apoptosis.
