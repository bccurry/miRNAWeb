microRNA expression profiling in multidrug resistance of the 5Fuinduced SGC7901 human gastric cancer cell line. The present study aimed to identify microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) in gastric carcinoma. A 5uorouracil (5Fu)induced MDR gastric cancer cell line was selected and miRNA expression profiling of the cell line was conducted following exposure to 5Fu. The miRNA expression profiles between the parental and resistant gastric cancer cells were analyzed by Human miRNA OneArrayv3 and the results were confirmed by quantitative realtime RTPCR. The expression of 9miRNAs (miR10b, 22, 31, 133b, 190, 501, 615, 5015p and 6155p) was upregulated while the expression of 18additional miRNAs (miR32, 197, 210, 766, 1229, 1238, 3131, 3149, 12243p, 31623p, 532, 877, 47015p, 5096, 47283p, 1273d, 4863p and47633p) was downregulated in the SGC7901/5Fu cell line compared with its parental cell line. The results indicate that miRNA expression correlates with MDR in gastric cancer and may serve as biomolecular targets for MDR elimination.
