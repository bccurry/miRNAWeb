MicroRNA-143 Downregulates Interleukin-13 Receptor Alpha1 in Human Mast Cells. MicroRNA-143 (miR-143) was found to be downregulated in allergic rhinitis, and bioinformatics analysis predicted that IL-13R1 was a target gene of miR-143. To understand the molecular mechanisms of miR-143 involved in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation, recombinant miR-143 plasmid vectors were constructed, and human mast cell-1(HMC-1) cells which play a central role in the allergic response were used for study. The plasmids were transfected into HMC-1 cells using a lentiviral vector. Expression of IL-13R1 mRNA was then detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western Blotting. The miR-143 lentiviral vector was successfully stably transfected in HMC-1 cells for target gene expression. Compared to the control, the target gene IL-13R1 was less expressed in HMC-1 transfected with miR-143 as determined by RT-PCR and Western Blotting (p &lt; 0.05); this difference in expression was statistically significant and the inhibition efficiency was 71%. It indicates that miR-143 directly targets IL-13R1 and suppresses IL-13R1 expression in HMC-1 cells. Therefore, miR-143 may be associated with allergic reaction in human mast cells.
