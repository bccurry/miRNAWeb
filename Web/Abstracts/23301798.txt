MicroRNA-126 regulates the induction and function of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells through PI3K/AKT pathway. Recent evidence showed that limited activation of PI3K/Akt pathway was critical for induction and function sustainment of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we reported that miR-126 was expressed in mouse and human Tregs. Further study showed that silencing of miR-126 using miR-126 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) could significantly reduce the induction of Tregs in vitro. Furthermore, miR-126 silencing could obviously reduce the expression of Foxp3 on Tregs, which was accompanied by decreased expression of CTLA-4 and GITR, as well as IL-10 and TGF-, and impair its suppressive function. Mechanistic evidence showed that silencing of miR-126 enhanced the expression of its target p85 and subsequently altered the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, which was ultimately responsible for reduced induction and suppressive function of Tregs. Finally, we further revealed that miR-126 silencing could impair the suppressive function of Tregs in vivo and endow effectively antitumour effect of CD8(+) T cells in adoptive cell transfer assay using a murine breast cancer model. Therefore, our study showed that miR-126 could act as fine-tuner in regulation of PI3K-Akt pathway transduction in the induction and sustained suppressive function of Tregs and provided a novel insight into the development of therapeutic strategies for promoting T-cell immunity by regulating Tregs through targeting specific miRNAs.
