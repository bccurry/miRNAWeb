Identification and characterization of a novel gene, C13orf25, as a target for 13q31-q32 amplification in malignant lymphoma. The amplification at 13q31-q32 has been reported in not only hematopoietic malignancies but also in other solid tumors. We identified previously frequent amplification of chromosomal band 13q31-q32 in 70 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients by conventional comparative genomic hybridization analysis. In an attempt to identify a candidate gene within this region, we used array comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization to map the 13q31-q32 amplicon. We then screened the 65 expressed sequence tags and Glypican 5 (GPC5) by reverse transcription-PCR and Northern blotting. As a result, we identified a novel gene, designated Chromosome 13 open reading frame 25 (C13orf25), which was overexpressed in B-cell lymphoma cell lines and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with 13q31-q32 amplifications. However, GPC5, which has been reported to be a target gene for 13q31-q32 amplification, was truncated in one cell line, Rec1, possessing the amplification, and its expression in various cell lines with amplification at 13q31-q32 was not significantly different from that in other cell lines without amplification, suggesting that GPC5 is not likely to be the candidate gene. Additional analysis identified two major transcripts in the C13orf25 gene. The two transcripts A and B predicted open reading frames of 32 and 70-amino acid polypeptides, respectively. The former has been reported as bA121J7.2, which is conserved among species. Transcript-B also contained seven mature microRNAs in its untranslated region. These results suggest that the C13orf25 gene is the most likely candidate gene for the 13q31-q32 amplicon found in hematopoietic malignancies.
