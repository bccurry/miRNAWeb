Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 13q14: miRs and more. Loss of a critical region in 13q14.3 [del(13q)] is the most common genomic aberration in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), occurring in more than 50% of patients (Stilgenbauer et al., Oncogene 1998;16:1891 - 1897, Dohner et al., N Engl J Med 2000;343:1910 - 1916). Despite extensive investigations, no point mutations have been found in the remaining allele that would inactivate one of the candidate tumor suppressor genes and explain the pathomechanism postulated for this region. However, the genes in the region are significantly down-regulated in CLL cells, more than would be expected by gene dosage, and recently a complex epigenetic regulatory mechanism was identified for 13q14.3 in non-malignant cells that involves asynchronous replication timing and monoallelic expression of candidate tumor suppressor genes. Here, we propose a model of a multigenic pathomechanism in 13q14.3, where several tumor suppressor genes, including the miRNA genes miR-16-1 and miR-15a, are co-regulated by the two long non-coding RNA genes DLEU1 and DLEU2 that span the critical region. Furthermore, we propose these co-regulated genes to be involved in the same molecular pathways, thereby also forming a functional gene cluster. Elucidating the molecular and cellular function of the 13q14.3 candidate genes will shed light on the underlying pathomechanism of CLL.
