Abate and switch: miR-145 in stem cell differentiation. MicroRNAs have been implicated as regulators of embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal and pluripotency. In this issue, Xu et al. (2009) demonstrate that miR-145 facilitates ES cell differentiation by repressing the core pluripotency factors OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4, thereby silencing the self-renewal program.
