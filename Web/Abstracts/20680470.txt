A functional varient in microRNA-146a is associated with risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Chinese Han. MicroRNAs are a new class of non-proteincoding, small RNAs that function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. They participate in diverse biological pathways and function as gene regulators. A G&gt;C polymorphism (rs2910164), which is located in the sequence of miR-146a precursor, results in a change from G:U to C:U in its stem region. However, it remains largely unknown whether this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) may alter esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) susceptibility. In the current study, we evaluated association between rs2910164 and ESCC susceptibility in a case-control study of 444 sporadic ESCC patients and 468 matched cancer-free controls in a Chinese Han population. Compared with rs2910164 variant genotype CC, genotype GG was associated with increased risk of ESCC (Odds Ratio, 2.39, 95% Confidence Interval, 1.36-4.20). In the smokers, the risk of rs2910164 GG genotype was more notable (Odds Ratio, 3.17, 95% Confidence Interval, 1.71-4.46). In the stratification analyses, we also found there was a strong correlation between rs2910164 C/G variant and the clinical TNM stage (P &lt; 0.01). These findings suggest that this functional SNP in pre-miR-146a could contribute to ESCC susceptibility and clinical outcome.
