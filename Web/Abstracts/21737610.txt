Therapy-, gender- and race-specific microRNA markers, target genes and networks related to glioblastoma recurrence and survival. To identify and study targets of microRNA biomarkers of glioblastoma survival across events (death and recurrence) and phases (life expectancy or post-diagnostic) using functional and network analyses. microRNAs associated with glioblastoma survival within and across race, gender, recurrence, and therapy cohorts were identified using 253 individuals, 534 microRNAs, Cox survival model, cross-validation, discriminant analyses, and cross-study comparison. All 45 microRNAs revealed as being associated with survival were confirmed in independent cancer studies and 25 in glioblastoma studies. Thirty-nine and six microRNAs (including hsa-miR-222) were associated with one and multiple glioblastoma survival indicators, respectively. Nineteen and 26 microRNAs exhibited cohort-dependent (including hsa-miR-10b with therapy and hsa-miR-486 with race) and independent associations with glioblastoma, respectively. Sensory perception and G protein-coupled receptor processes were enriched among microRNA gene targets also associated with survival and network visualization highlighted their relations. These findings can help to improve prognostic tools and personalized treatments.
