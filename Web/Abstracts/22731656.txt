MicroRNA 17-92 expressed by transposone based vector changes expression level of cell cycle related genes. The miR-17-92 cluster is composed of seven miRNAs (mir-17-5p, -17-3p, -18a, -19a, -20a, -19b-1, and -92a-1). Previous studies have indicated that this cluster is involved in cell proliferation and their over-expression is seen in several types of cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the over-expression effects of miR-17-92 on expression of several genes that are associated with regulation of cell cycle. In the present study, human miR-17-92 gene was cloned into a transposone based vector, piggyBac, and transfected into HEK293T cell line. Gene expression analysis indicated that up-regulation of this cluster causes significant changes on the expression level of several cell cycle related genes such as cdk2, cyclinD2, c-myc and CREB. In line with this finding other methods of transcripts assessment confirmed miR-17-92 over-expression has enhanced cell proliferation.
