Increased miRNA-146a and miRNA-155 expressions in oral lichen planus. Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease T helper 1 lymphocytes (Th1)-mediated. Interferon-gamma (IFN-) plays a central role in local immune response in this disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed non-coding RNAs that have important biological and pathological functions due to their potential mechanism regulating gene expression. Recently, some studies have demonstrated that miRNA-146a and miRNA-155 participate in immune response regulation, and are important in several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the expression of the miRNA-146a and miRNA-155 in 31 OLP lesions compared to normal oral mucosa and blood samples. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze miRNA expressions. Our results showed increased expression of miRNA-146a and miRNA-155 in OLP lesions. In conclusion, these data highlight the possibility of miRNA-146a and miRNA-155 involvement in the regulation of the immune response in OLP.
