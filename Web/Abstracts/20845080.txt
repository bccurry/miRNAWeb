Association of pre-microRNAs genetic variants with susceptibility in systemic lupus erythematosus. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may play important roles in SLE, but genetic polymorphisms of miRNAs and their relationships with various autoantibodies present in SLE patients remain unclear. Here, we report that 213 SLE patients and 209 healthy individuals of Chinese had been taken into this case-control studies, which had been performed by selecting two miRNAs (hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 G&gt;C, and hsa-mir-499 rs3746444 T&gt;C) to analyze the genetic polymorphisms. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants had been analyzed by PCR-RFLP and serum anti-ribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP), anti-Sm nuclear antigen (anti-Sm) antibodies had been determined by an anti-ENA kit and serum anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies had been assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. We found that hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 and hsa-mir-499 rs3746444 polymorphisms had no significant relationship with SLE susceptibility. The genotype frequencies of rs2910164 (GG, CC, and GC) were 16, 37, and 47% in SLE patients, but 11, 39, and 50% in healthy group (P = 0.397), respectively; The genotype frequencies of rs3746444 (CC, TT, and TC) were 3, 74, and 23% in SLE patients, but 3, 76, and 22% in healthy group (P = 0.892), respectively. The G and C allele frequencies of rs2910164 were 39 and 61% in SLE patients, but 36 and 64% in healthy group (P = 0.990), respectively. The C and T allele frequencies of rs3746444 were 15 and 85% in SLE patients, but 14 and 86% in healthy group (P = 0.702), respectively. In addition, we also showed no significant difference in the distribution of rs2910164 and rs3746444 genotypes in each of the three antibodies (anti-RNP, anti-Sm, and anti-dsDNA).
