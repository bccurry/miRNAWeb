Polymorphic miRNA-mediated gene contribution to inhibitor development in haemophilia A. Development of inhibitory antibodies is perhaps the most serious complication of FVIII replacement therapy, precluding efficient clinical management of patients with haemophilia A (HA). The development and function of immune system are also regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). Mutations and changes in the level of expression of some miRNA genes have been associated with the onset and progression of immunological disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate new genetic polymorphisms in loci for miRNA and their targets to evaluate whether these SNPs may confer susceptibility to inhibitor development in patients with HA. Italian HA patients with and without inhibitors and healthy controls were recruited in this study. For SNP analysis, standard DNA sequencing method was used. We have studied four SNPs, i.e. rs36101366, rs34683807, rs1803603 and rs3024496 located in the 3'UTR of F8 and IL-10 genes. These SNPs have been checked for their frequencies in patients with and without inhibitors, but no statistically significant differences were found. Then, we have searched for other genetic variants in loci for haematopoietic-specific miRNAs, i.e. hsa-mir-150, hsa-mir-155, hsa-mir-146a, hsa-mir-142, hsa-mir-181a and in a specific miRNA, hsa-mir-1184, i.e. predicted to be located in the intron 22 of F8 gene. For all miRNAs selected, we did not identify any sequence variation in our study population. This is the first study to demonstrate that there was no association between selected SNPs in miRNAs and their targets and the susceptibility to inhibitor development in people affected by HA.
