MiR-222 overexpression confers cell migratory advantages in hepatocellular carcinoma through enhancing AKT signaling. This study aims to profile the expressions of 156 microRNAs (miRNA) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to characterize the functions of miR-222, the most significantly upregulated candidate identified. miRNA expression profile in HCC tumors, matching adjacent cirrhotic livers, and cell lines was conducted using quantitative PCR. Common miR-222 upregulations were further validated in a larger cohort of tumors. The functional effects of miR-222 inhibition on HCC cell lines were examined. The downstream modulated pathways and target of miR-222 were investigated by coupling gene expression profiling and pathway analysis, and by in silico prediction, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was done to confirm target interaction. We identified a 40-miRNA signature that could discriminate tumors from adjacent cirrhotic liver tissue, and further corroborated common miR-222 overexpression in tumors relative to its premalignant counterpart (55.3%; P &lt; 0.0001). Increased miR-222 expression correlated significantly with advanced stage HCC and with the shorter disease-free survival of patients (P &lt; or = 0.01). Inhibition of miR-222 in Hep3B and HKCI-9 significantly retarded cell motility (P &lt; 0.05). Further investigations suggested that AKT signaling was the major pathway influenced by miR-222. A consistent reduction of AKT phosphorylation in Hep3B and HKCI-9 was shown following miR-222 suppression. The protein phosphatase 2A subunit B (PPP2R2A) was predicted as a putative miR-222 target in silico. We found that miR-222 inhibition could augment the tumor protein level and restore luciferase activity in reporter construct containing the PPP2R2A 3' untranslated region (P = 0.0066). Our study showed that miR-222 overexpression is common in HCC and could confer metastatic potentials in HCC cells, possibly through activating AKT signaling.
