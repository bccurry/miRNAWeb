microRNA-146a targets the L1 cell adhesion molecule and suppresses the metastatic potential of gastric cancer. Recent studies have shown that microRNA-146a (miR-146a) is associated with cancer metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential role of miR-146a in gastric cancer metastasis. A wound-healing assay and a Transwell assay were used to investigate the impact of miR-146a on the migratory and invasive abilities of MKN-45 cells invitro. MKN-45 cells stably expressing miR-146a or the negative control were transplanted into nude mice through the lateral tail vein to explore the effect of miR-146a on tumor metastasis invivo. A luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis were used to identify the potential target genes. Our results show that the overexpression of miR-146a inhibits the invasion and metastasis of MKN-45 cells invitro and invivo. Furthermore, the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) was identified as a novel target of miR146a in gastric cancer. Taken together, our results provide evidence that miR-146a suppresses gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis invitro and invivo, which may be in part due to the downregulation of L1CAM. miR-146a may have the therapeutic potential to suppress gastric cancer metastasis.
