The association between two polymorphisms in pre-miRNAs and breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis. Emerging evidence has shown that miRNAs participate in human carcinogenesis as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) which located in the pre-miRNA may affect the processing and then influence the expression of mature miRNA. Previous studies yielded conflicting results as to the association of two common polymorphisms in pre-miRNAs (i.e. hsa-miR-146 rs2910164 and hsa-miR-196a2 rs11614913) with breast cancer. To derive a more precise effect on the association between these polymorphisms and breast cancer risk, we conducted a meta-analysis. Through retrieving PubMed for the period up to May 2010, a total of four studies were identified with 3,007 cases and 3,718 controls for has-miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and with 3,287 cases and 4,298 controls for hsa-miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism. We found that individuals carrying CC genotype of has-miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism was associated with an increased breast cancer risk in homozygote comparison (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.01-1.68), and dominant model (OR = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.23). However, no significant association between has-miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and breast cancer risk was observed in all comparison models tested. These findings suggest that has-miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism may play crucial roles in breast cancer development.
