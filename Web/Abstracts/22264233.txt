Transforming growth factor 1 represses proximal tubular cell microRNA-192 expression through decreased hepatocyte nuclear factor DNA binding. miR (microRNA)-192 plays key roles in renal pathological and physiological responses, by repressing targets including Zeb1, Zeb2 and Wnk1. In the present study, we have assessed the regulation of miR-192 expression. We found that TGF-1 (transforming growth factor 1) down-regulates miR-192 and miR-194, co-transcribed in the shared precursor pri-miR (primary miR transcript)-192/194. Luciferase reporter analysis showed constitutive promoter activity within nucleotides +21 to -223. We identified HNF (hepatocyte nuclear factor) and p53 binding sites within this region that were required for constitutive promoter activity, which was decreased by TGF-1 through an Alk5-dependent mechanism. TGF-1 treatment decreased HNF binding to the miR-194-2/192 promoter, whereas knockdown of HNF-1 inhibited mature miR-192 and miR-194 expression. miR-192, miR-194 and HNF expression were restricted to a defined subset of human tissues including kidney, small intestine, colon and liver. Our results from the present study identify co-ordinated regulation of miR-192 and miR-194, with binding of HNF and p53 transcription factors necessary for activation of transcription, and TGF-1-mediated repression through decreased HNF binding to its cognate promoter element.
