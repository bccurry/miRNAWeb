[MiR-196a-2 gene polymorphism and the antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis C]. To investigate the relationship between the SNP rs11614913 on miR196a-2 gene and the treatment effects of Peg-IFN-a plus Ribavirin on chronic hepatitis C patients. The total 139 patients of chronic hepatitis C infection who received the treatment of Peg-IFN-alpha-2a or Peg-IFN-alpha-2b plus Ribavirin were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups: sustained virological response (SVR) (n = 82) group and non virological response (NVR) or recurrence (n = 57) group. Blood samples were collected and chromosomal DNA was extracted. The miR-196a-2 polymorphism was determined with the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). In our study, there was statistically association between miR-196a-2 polymorphism and the antiviral therapy efficacy of hepatitis C patients. There was statistically significance in the CT genotype and the TT genotype of miR-196a-2 between the two groups [P = 0.009, A = 2.924 (1.285 -6.652)]. There was statistically significance in the CC genotype and the TT genotype between the two groups [P = 0.036, A = 3.091(1.052 -9.078)]. There was statistically significance in the C allele and the T allele between the two groups [P = 0.036, A = 3.091 (1.052 - 9.078)]. These findings suggested that the rs11614913 SNP in miR - 196a-2 be associated with the antiviral therapy efficacy of hepatitis C patients, and the TT genotype or T alleles be associated with the SVR while the CC genotype or C allele could be related to the NVR or recurrence.
