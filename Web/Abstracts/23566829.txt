No association of functional variant in pri-miR-218 and risk of congenital heart disease in a Chinese population. MiR-218 plays an important role in heart development in zebrafish. pri-miR-218 rs11134527 variant is associated with cervical cancer carcinogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in pri-miR-218 might influence susceptibility to sporadic congenital heart disease (CHD). We conducted a case-control study of CHD in a Chinese population to test our hypothesis by sequencing and genotyping pri-miR-218 in 1116 CHD cases and 1219 non-CHD controls. We identified one SNP rs11134527 located in pri-miR-218 sequence. Logistic regression analyses showed that there was no significant association in genotype and allele frequencies of pri-miR-218 rs11134527 A/G polymorphism between CHD cases in overall or various subtypes and the control group. However, real-time PCR analysis showed that rs11134527 allele G significantly increased mature miR-218 expression. In vitro binding assays further revealed that the rs11134527 variant affects miR-218-mediated regulation of Robo1. This is the first study to investigate the relationship between miR-218 and CHD cases. Our results demonstrate that the functional variant rs11134527 in pri-miR-218 has no major role in genetic susceptibility to sporadic CHD, at least in the population studied here.
