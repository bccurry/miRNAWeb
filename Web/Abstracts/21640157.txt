Bcl-2 is a better therapeutic target than c-Myc, but attacking both could be a more effective treatment strategy for B-cell lymphoma with concurrentBcl-2 and c-Myc overexpression. The prognosis for diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with concomitant overexpression of c-Myc and Bcl-2 remains dismal; there is an urgent need to clarify the significance of these two oncogenes as therapeutic targets for a more effective treatment strategy. We established two novel cell lines, KPUM-MS3 and KPUM-UH1, from two chemoresistant patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with concomitant overexpression of c-Myc and Bcl-2, and investigated the significance of c-Myc and Bcl-2 as therapeutic targets. KPUM-MS3 possesses t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation and KPUM-UH1 bcl-2 gene amplification, both of which account for Bcl-2 overexpression. Chromosomal translocation t(8;14)(q24;q34) was found to coexist only in KPUM-UH1, overexpression of pvt-1 messenger RNA was detected only in KPUM-MS3, and reduced expression of miR-143 and miR-145 was identified in both. Working together, these abnormalities can contribute to c-Myc overexpression. Using ABT-263, an inhibitor for Bcl-2, and 10058-F4, an inhibitor for c-Myc, we found that both cell lines were more highly sensitive to cell death as a result of Bcl-2 inhibition than of c-Myc inhibition. When combined with genotoxic agents, ABT-263 exerted additive and/or synergistic cell-killing effects, while 10058-F4 showed, at most, a modest combinatory effect. Importantly, the combination of ABT-263 and 10058-F4 had a synergistic cell-killing effect on both cell lines. Our data suggest that Bcl-2 is a better therapeutic target than c-Myc, but attacking both Bcl-2 and c-Myc would be an even more effective treatment strategy for diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with concurrent Bcl-2 and c-Myc overexpression.
