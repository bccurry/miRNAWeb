[MicroRNA profiling in T cells of peripheral blood mononuclear cell from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis]. To explore the expression pattern of microRNA (miRNA) in T cells of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The expression profile of miRNA in T cells of PBMC was determined by microarray assay and validated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In comparison with the healthy controls, 23 miRNA were down-regulated and 2 miRNA had a higher expression (all P &lt; 0.05). As revealed by qRT-PCR, the expressions of miR-346, miR-17-5p, miR-20a and miR-let-7b decreased obviously while miR-451 and miR-129 became up-regulated. The results were in agreement with those of microarray. The PBC patients and healthy controls have significantly different expression profiles of microRNA in T cells of PBMC. The differential expression of microRNA may be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC.
