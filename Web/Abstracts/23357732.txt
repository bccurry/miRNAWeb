miR-132 enhances HIV-1 replication. MicroRNAs upregulated during CD4(+) T cell activation may contribute to the increased efficiency of HIV-1 replication seen following perturbation of the resting state. We have found miR-132 to be highly upregulated following CD4(+) T cell activation, and show that miR-132 potentiates viral replication in the Jurkat CD4(+) T cell line. Knockdown of MeCP2, a previously identified target of miR-132, also increases HIV-1 replication. To the best of our knowledge, miR-132 is the first miRNA reported to enhance HIV-1 replication.
