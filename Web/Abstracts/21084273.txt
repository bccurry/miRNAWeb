An illegitimate microRNA target site within the 3' UTR of MDM4 affects ovarian cancer progression and chemosensitivity. Overexpression of MDM4 (also known as MDMX or HDMX) is thought to promote tumorigenesis by decreasing p53 tumor suppressor function. Even modest decrease in Mdm4 levels affects tumorigenesis in mice, suggesting that genetic variants of MDM4 might have similar effects in humans. We sequenced the MDM4 gene in a series of ovarian cancer cell lines and carcinomas to identify mutations and/or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We identified an SNP (SNP34091) in the 3'-UTR of MDM4 that creates a putative target site for hsa-miR-191, a microRNA that is highly expressed in normal and tumor tissues. Biochemical evidence supports specific miR-191-dependent regulation of the MDM4-C, but not MDM4-A, variant. Consistently, the A-allele was associated with statistically significant increased expression of MDM4 mRNA and protein levels in ovarian carcinomas. Importantly, the wild-type genotype (A/A) is more frequent (57.8% vs. 42.2% for A/C and C/C, respectively) in patients with high-grade carcinomas than in patients with low-grade carcinomas (47.2% vs. 52.5% for A/A and A/C + C/C, respectively). Moreover, A/A patients who do not express the estrogen receptor had a 4.2-fold [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-13.5; P = 0.02] increased risk of recurrence and 5.5-fold (95% CI = 1.5-20.5; P = 0.01) increased risk of tumor-related death. Unexpectedly, the frequency of p53 mutations was not significantly lower in A/A patients. We conclude that acquisition of an illegitimate miR-191 target site causes downregulation of MDM4 expression, thereby significantly delaying ovarian carcinoma progression and tumor-related death. Importantly, these effects appear to be, at least partly, independent of p53.
