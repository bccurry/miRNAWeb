Epigenetic silencing of microRNA-373 plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation in colon cancer. microRNAs (miRNA) are non-coding RNAs that negatively control gene expression by cleaving or inhibiting the translation of target gene mRNAs. We used a microarray-based transcriptomic analysis to identify miRNA expression levels that changed in response to epigenetic factors. Specifically, we searched for increased expression of miRNAs prepared from colon cancer cell line DLD-1 after a 96-h treatment with 5 M of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC). Among those identified, transient transfection of miRNA hsa-miR-373 resulted in cytostasis. In addition, bisulfate sequence analysis of the promoter regions of these miRNAs showed aberrant methylation in the cancer cells. In clinical colon samples, hsa-miR-373 was down-regulated in colon cancers (29/40, 72.5%) relative to control samples, whereas the purported oncogene RAB22A (a target gene of hsa-miR-373) was up-regulated (24/40, 60%). Using methylation-specific PCR, we also observed aberrant methylation of hsa-miR-373 in colon cancers (35/40, 87.5%) relative to controls (8/40, 20%). Based on these results, we conclude that expression of hsa-miR-373 is down-regulated by aberrant methylation in colon cancer and that this miRNA may function by regulating expression of the oncogene RAB22A.
