Differential roles of miR-199a-5p in radiation-induced autophagy in breast cancer cells. Autophagy is a self-degrading process that is triggered by diverse stimuli including ionizing radiation. In this study we show novel phenomena in which transfection of miR-199a-5p mimic significantly suppresses IR-induced autophagy in MCF7 cells, and up-regulates basal and IR-induced autophagy in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We also identify DRAM1 and Beclin1 as novel target genes for miR-199a-5p. Overexpression of miR-199a-5p inhibits DRAM1 and Beclin1 expression in MCF7 cells, while it enhances expression of these genes in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, we show that miR-199a-5p sensitizes MDA-MB-231 cells to irradiation. Therefore, our data identify miR-199a-5p as a novel and unique regulator of autophagy, which plays an important role in cancer biology and cancer therapy.
