MicroRNA-93 regulates NRF2 expression and is associated with breast carcinogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of approximately 60% of all human genes and play important roles in disease processes. Recent studies have demonstrated a link between dysregulated expression of miRNAs and breast carcinogenesis. Long-term estrogen exposure is implicated in development of human breast cancers, yet underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We have recently demonstrated that antioxidant vitamin C (vit C) prevents estrogen-induced breast tumor development. In this study, we investigated the role of vit C in the regulation of microRNA-93 (miR-93) and its target gene(s) in a rat model of mammary carcinogenesis. Female August Copenhagen Irish (ACI) rats were treated with vit C in the presence or absence of 17-estradiol (E2) for 8 months. We demonstrate an increased expression of the miR-93 in E2-treated mammary tissues and in human breast cell lines and vit C treatment reverted E2-mediated increase in miR-93 levels. MiRNA target prediction programs suggest one of the target genes of miR-93 to be nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). In contrast with miR-93 expression, NRF2 protein expression was significantly decreased in E2-treated mammary tissues, mammary tumors, and in breast cancer cell lines, and its expression was significantly increased after vit C treatment. Ectopic expression of miR-93 decreased protein expression of NRF2 and NRF2-regulated genes. Furthermore, miR-93 decreased apoptosis, increased colony formation, mammosphere formation, cell migration and DNA damage in breast epithelial cells, whereas silencing of miR-93 in these cells inhibited these carcinogenic processes. Taken together, our findings suggest an oncogenic potential of miR-93 during E2-induced breast carcinogenesis.
