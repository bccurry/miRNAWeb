miR-17-5p as a novel prognostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma. miRNAs are frequently deregulated in cancer and have shown promise as tissue-based markers for cancer classification and prognostication. Emerging evidence indicates that miR-17-5p plays an important role in carcinogenesis. However, the expression of miR-17-5p in HCC tissues and its clinical relevance has not been systematically studied yet, and whether miR-17-5p expression has influence on prognosis of HCC is still unknown. In this study, we investigate the expression and clinical significance of miR-17-5p in human HCC. The expression levels of miR-17-5p were measured in 120 paired hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and paracarcinomatous liver tissues (PCLTs) derived from patients who underwent hepatic resection by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the correlation of miR-17-5p levels with clinicopathologic variables and prognosis was analyzed. miR-17-5p was significantly upregulated in HCCs (p &lt; .001). Furthermore, HCC with metastasis had higher miR-17-5p levels than that without metastasis (p &lt; .001). Importantly, the elevated expression of miR-17-5p correlated with multiple tumor nodules (p = .046), worse Edmondson-Steiner grade (p = .024), vein invasion (p = .001), shortened overall survival (p = .012), and disease-free survival (p = .011) of HCC. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that miR-17-5p was an independent risk factor for overall survival and disease-free survival (p = .002 and p = .042, respectively). miR-17-5p is highly elevated in HCC, especially in HCC with metastasis. miR-17-5p can serve as a novel prognostic marker for HCC.
