Analysis of hsa-miR-30a-5p Expression in Human Gliomas. Our previous study demonstrated that miR-30a-5p was upregulated in six malignant glioma cell lines by microRNA(miRNA) array. For further verification of this finding, the expression of miR-30a-5p in 7 more malignant glioma cell lines, 43 freshly resected glioma samples and 75 archival paraffin embedded glioma specimens with different grade of malignancy were examined by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization(ISH). Here, we present the first evidence that miR-30a-5p is overexpressed in glioma cell lines and glioma samples as compared to the normal brain tissues (NBTs), and its expression level is positively correlated with tumor grade of malignancy. It is concluded that miR-30a-5p may have the potential as a diagnostic or prognostic marker of gliomas and as the target of miRNA-based glioma therapy in further studies.
