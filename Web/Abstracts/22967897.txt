MiR-136 promotes apoptosis of glioma cells by targeting AEG-1 and Bcl-2. MicroRNAs have the capacity to coordinately repress multiple target genes and interfere with biological functions of the cell, such as proliferation and apoptosis. Here we report that miR-136 is downregulated in human glioma, and that the miRNA promotes apoptosis of glioma cells induced by chemotherapy. Two anti-apoptotic genes, AEG-1 and Bcl-2, are identified as targets of miR-136, and restoration of AEG-1 or Bcl-2 expression suppresses miR-136-enhanced apoptosis. Therefore, miR-136 might play a tumor-suppressive role in human glioma and thereby might represent a potential therapeutic strategy.
