Overexpression of microRNA-1 promotes cardiomyocyte commitment from human cardiovascular progenitors via suppressing WNT and FGF signaling pathways. Early heart development takes place through a complex series of steps, including the induction of cardiac mesoderm, formation of the cardiovascular progenitor cells and the commitment of cardiovascular lineage cells, such as cardiomyocytes (CMs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). Recently, microRNAs, a family of endogenous, small non-coding RNAs, have been identified as critical regulators in cardiogenesis and cardiovascular disease. Previous studies demonstrated that microRNA-1 (miR-1) could promote cardiac differentiation from mouse and human embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, the underlying mechanism remained largely unclear. We performed microRNA deep sequencing among human ES cells, ES cell derived-multipotent cardiovascular progenitors (MCPs), and MCP-specified CMs, ECs, and SMCs. A specific enrichment of miR-1 was found in CMs, not in SMCs or ECs, implying a key role of miR-1 in determining cardiovascular commitment from MCPs. When overexpressed in human induced pluripotent stem cells, miR-1 enhanced the expression of key cardiac transcriptional factors and sarcomeric genes. Importantly, we found miR-1 promoted CM differentiation and suppressed EC commitment from MCPs by modulating the activities of WNT and FGF signaling pathways. FZD7 and FRS2 were confirmed as miR-1 targets using luciferase reporter assay and western blot. Overall, this study reveals a fate-switching role of miR-1 at early human cardiovascular commitment stage via suppressing both WNT and FGF signaling pathways.
