MicroRNA-365 regulates NKX2-1, a key mediator of lung cancer. MicroRNAs constitute a class of small noncoding RNAs that play roles in tumorigenesis. We found that NKX2-1 protein levels were generally high in the lung cancer tissues whereas miRNA-365 expression levels were downregulated. Ectopic miR-365 expression decreased NKX2-1 expression in lung cancer cell lines. Transfection of a miR-365 mimic led to reduced proliferation of lung cancer cells; conversely, a miR-365 inhibitor slightly increased cell proliferation. The NKX2-1 overexpression significantly increased the cell proliferation by overcoming the suppressive effect of miR-365. Our data suggest that miR-365 is an important regulator of NKX2-1 and can be a target for lung cancer therapies.
