Overexpression of miR-370 and downregulation of its novel target TGF-RII contribute to the progression of gastric carcinoma. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs that are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of tumors. Gastric carcinoma (GC) is a common malignancy worldwide. The aim of this study was the identification of the expression signature and functional roles of aberrant miRNAs in GC. Initial screening established a profile of aberrantly expressed miRNAs in tumors. miR-370 was confirmed to be overexpressed in GC tissues. Higher expression of miR-370 in GC tissues was associated with more advanced nodal metastasis and a higher clinical stage compared with controls. In addition, significantly higher level of miR-370 was noted in the plasma of GC patients compared with controls. Patients having more invasive or advanced tumors also exhibited a higher plasma level of miR-370. In vitro assays indicated that exogenous miR-370 expression enhanced the oncogenic potential of GC cells. The AGS-GFPM2 cells with exogenous miR-370 expression also exhibited enhanced abdominal metastatic dissemination in nude mice. Reporter assays confirmed that miR-370 targeted predicted sites in 3'UTR of transforming growth factor- receptor II (TGF-RII) gene. The exogenous miR-370 expression decreased TGF-RII expression and the phosphorylation of Smad3 elicited by TGF1. The TGF1-mediated repression in cell migration was reverted by exogenous miR-370 expression. A reverse correlation between miR-370 and TGF-RII expression was noted in GC tissues. This study concludes that miR-370 is a miRNA that is associated with GC progression by downregulating TGF-RII. The miRNA expression profile described in this study should contribute to future studies on the role of miRNAs in GC.
