A short hairpin DNA analogous to miR-125b inhibits C-Raf expression, proliferation, and survival of breast cancer cells. The noncoding RNA miR-125b has been described to reduce ErbB2 protein expression as well as proliferation and migration of cancer cell lines. As additional target of miR-125b, we identified the c-raf-1 mRNA by sequence analysis. We designed a short hairpin-looped oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) targeted to the same 3' untranslated region of c-raf-1 mRNA as miR-125b. The fully complementary ODN antisense strand is linked to a second strand constituting a partially double-stranded structure of the ODN. Transfection of the c-raf-1-specific ODN (ODN-Raf) in a breast cancer cell line reduced the protein levels of C-Raf, ErbB2, and their downstream effector cyclin D1 similar to miR-125b. MiR-125b as well as ODN-Raf showed no effect on the c-raf-1 mRNA level in contrast to small interfering RNA. Unlike miR-125b, ODN-Raf induced a cytopathic effect. This may be explained by the structural properties of ODN-Raf, which can form G-tetrads. Thus, the short hairpin-looped ODN-Raf, targeting the same region of c-raf-1 as miR-125b, is a multifunctional molecule reducing the expression of oncoproteins and stimulating cell death. Both features may be useful to interfere with tumor growth.
