Comparative study of anti-oncogenic microRNA-145 in canine and human malignant melanoma. MicroRNA-145 (miRNA-145; miR-145) is aberrantly expressed in most of human cancers and plays a significant role in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. In the current study, we focused on how miR-145 plays a role in canine and human malignant melanomas. MiR-145 was significantly downregulated in canine malignant melanoma tissues and canine melanoma cell lines, as well as human melanoma cell lines tested. The ectopic expression of miR-145 showed a significant growth inhibition in both canine and human melanoma cells tested, and the effect was achieved partly by suppressing c-MYC in canine melanoma LMeC and in human melanoma A2058 and Mewo cells. At the same time, a suppressive tendency on cell migration in canine melanoma KMeC cells and significant suppression of cell migration in human melanoma A2058 cells by suppressing FASCIN1 were also found. These findings suggest that miR-145 acts as a tumor suppressor in both canine and human malignant melanomas.
