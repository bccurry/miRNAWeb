Hsa-miR-196a2 Rs11614913 polymorphism contributes to cancer susceptibility: evidence from 15 case-control studies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of endogenous, small and noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression by suppressing translation or degrading mRNAs. Recently, many studies investigated the association between hsa-miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism and cancer risk, which showed inconclusive results. We conducted a meta-analysis of 15 studies that included 9,341 cancer cases and 10,569 case-free controls. We assessed the strength of the association, using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Overall, individuals with the TC/CC genotypes were associated with higher cancer risk than those with the TT genotype (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.03-1.34, P&lt;0.001 for heterogeneity test). In the stratified analyses, we observed that the CC genotype might modulate breast cancer risk (OR=1.11, 95%CI=1.01-1.23, Pheterogeneity=0.210) and lung cancer risk (OR=1.25, 95%CI=1.06-1.46, Pheterogeneity=0.958), comparing with the TC/TT genotype. Moreover, a significantly increased risk was found among Asian populations in a dominant model (TC/CC versus TT, OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.07-1.43, Pheterogeneity=0.006). These findings supported that hsa-miR-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism may contribute to the susceptibility of cancers.
