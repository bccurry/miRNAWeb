PPAR is regulated by miR-21 and miR-27b in human liver. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) is an important transcriptional factor that regulates genes encoding endo/xenobiotic enzymes and lipid metabolizing enzymes. In this study, we investigated whether microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of PPAR in human liver. Precursor or antisense oligonucleotide for miR-21 or miR-27b was transfected into HuH7 cells; expression of PPAR and acyl-CoA synthetase M2B was determined by Western blot and real-time RT-PCR. Luciferase assay was performed to identify the functional miRNA recognition element (MRE). Expression levels of PPAR, miR-21, and miR-27b in a panel of 24 human livers were determined. The overexpression and inhibition of miR-21 or miR-27b in HuH7 cells significantly decreased and increased the PPAR protein level, respectively, but not PPAR mRNA level. The miRNA-dependent regulation of PPAR affected the expression of its downstream gene. Luciferase assay identified a functional MRE for miR-21 in the 3'-untranslated region of PPAR. In human livers, the PPAR protein levels were not correlated with PPAR mRNA, but inversely correlated with the miR-21 levels, suggesting a substantial impact of miR-21, although the contribution of miR-27b could not be ruled out. We found that PPAR in human liver is regulated by miRNAs.
