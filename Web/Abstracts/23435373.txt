MicroRNA-25 functions as a potential tumor suppressor in colon cancer by targeting Smad7. Because it is a member of the miR-106b~25 cluster, microRNA-25 (miR-25) is known to be dysregulated in human cancers. However, the expression and role of miR-25 in colon cancer remain unclear. In this study, miR-25 was found to be down-regulated in human colon cancer tissues when compared to those in matched, non-neoplastic mucosa tissues. Functional studies revealed that restoration of miR-25 expression inhibited cell proliferation and migration. In contrast, miR-25 inhibition could promote the proliferation and migratory ability of cells. Stable over-expression of miR-25 also suppressed the growth of colon cancer-cell xenografts in vivo. Furthermore, bioinformatic predictions and experimental validation were used to identify Smad7 as a direct target of miR-25. Functional reverse experiments indicated that the antitumor effects of miR-25 were probably mediated by its repression of Smad7. These results suggest that miR-25 may function as a tumor suppressor by targeting Smad7 in colon cancer. Thus, miR-25 may serve as a potential therapeutic agent or target for cancer therapy.
