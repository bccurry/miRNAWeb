MicroRNA-155 as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases. MicroRNAs are short non-coding molecules expressed in different tissues and regulate the transcription of different genes. They are highly specific in their action. Upregulation or downregulation of specific microRNAs has been observed during different diseases like cancers, embryogenesis, organogenesis, apoptosis and arthritis. They are also known to be involved in autoimmune diseases. MicroRNAs are also found to be stable and easy to validate. Differential expression of microRNA-155 has been studied by different groups in inflammatory diseases including arthritis along with other miRNAs. This suggests that it can be used as a potential biomarker or therapeutic in the autoimmune diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis. Experimental studies are needed to explore their role as biomarker or therapeutic.
