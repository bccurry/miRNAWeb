MicroRNAs - Novel Therapeutic Targets of Eicosanoid Signalling. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important regulators in human physiological and pathological processes. We summarize the current knowledge about the role of miRNA involved in the control of inflammatory responses with a special focus on eicosanoid signalling. Cyclooxygenase 2 - the key enzyme of the prostanoid pathway - is regulated by different miRNAs like miRNA-101, miR199a, miR26b and miR-146a. In contrast to this, the understanding of miRNA regulation on enzymes of the leukotriene biosynthesis is just at the beginning. The knowledge of miRNAs regulating enzymes of the eicosanoid pathway offers a new way for the development of new therapeutic concepts for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
