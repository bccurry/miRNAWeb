Serum miR-146a and miR-223 as potential new biomarkers for sepsis. Current biomarkers cannot completely distinguish sepsis from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by other non-infectious diseases. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising biomarkers for several diseases, but their correlation with sepsis is not totally clarified. Seven miRNAs related to inflammation or infection were included in the present study. Serum miRNA expression was investigated in 50 patients diagnosed with sepsis, 30 patients with SIRS and 20 healthy controls to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value. Expression levels of serum miRNAs were determined by quantitative PCR using the Qiagen miScript system. Serum CRP and IL-6 levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Serum miR-146a and miR-223 were significantly reduced in septic patients compared with SIRS patients and healthy controls. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of miR-146a, miR-223 and IL-6 were 0.858, 0.804 and 0.785, respectively. Serum miR-146a and miR-223 might serve as new biomarkers for sepsis with high specificity and sensitivity. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00862290.).
