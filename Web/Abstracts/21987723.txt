Targets of the tumor suppressor miR-200 in regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer. The microRNA-200 (miR-200) family restricts epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in tumor cell lines derived from mice that develop metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. To determine the mechanisms responsible for EMT and metastasis regulated by this microRNA, we conducted a global liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis to compare metastatic and nonmetastatic murine lung adenocarcinoma cells which had undergone EMT because of loss of miR-200. An analysis of syngeneic tumors generated by these cells identified multiple novel proteins linked to metastasis. In particular, the analysis of conditioned media, cell surface proteins, and whole-cell lysates from metastatic and nonmetastatic cells revealed large-scale modifications in the tumor microenvironment. Specific increases were documented in extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, peptidases, and changes in distribution of cell adhesion proteins in the metastatic cell lines. Integrating proteomic data from three subproteomes, we defined constituents of a multilayer protein network that both regulated and mediated the effects of TGF. Lastly, we identified ECM proteins and peptidases that were directly regulated by miR-200. Taken together, our results reveal how expression of miR-200 alters the tumor microenvironment to inhibit the processes of EMT and metastasis.
