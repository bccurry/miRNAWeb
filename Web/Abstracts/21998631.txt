MiR-886-3p regulates cell proliferation and migration, and is dysregulated in familial non-medullary thyroid cancer. The molecular basis and characteristics of familial non-medullary thyroid cancer are poorly understood. In this study, we performed microRNA (miRNA) profiling of familial and sporadic papillary thyroid cancer tumor samples. Genome wide miRNA profiling of sporadic and familial papillary thyroid cancer was performed. Differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Ectopic expression of miR-886-3p in thyroid cancer lines was performed to identify pathways targeted by the miRNA, as well as, to determine its effect on tumor cell biology. We found four differentially expressed miRNAs between familial and sporadic papillary thyroid cancer tumor samples. MiR-886-3p and miR-20a were validated to be differentially expressed by 3- and 4-fold, respectively. Pathway analysis of genome-wide expression data on cells overexpressing miR-886-3p and target prediction analysis showed genes involved in DNA replication and focal adhesion pathways were regulated by miR-886-3p. Overexpression of miR-886-3p in thyroid cancer cell lines significantly inhibited cellular proliferation, the number and size of spheroids and cellular migration. Additionally, overexpression of miR-886-3p increased the number of cells in S phase. Our findings for the first time suggest that miR-886-3p plays an important role in thyroid cancer tumor cell biology and regulates genes involved in DNA replication and focal adhesion. Thus, miR-886-3p may play a role in the initiation and or progression of papillary thyroid cancer.
