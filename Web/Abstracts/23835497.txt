MicroRNA-128 promotes cell-cell adhesion in U87 glioma cells via regulation of EphB2. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs which regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Abnormal expression of miRNAs occurs frequently in human tumors. Despite the fact that reduced expression of miR-128 has been observed in glioma tissues and cells, the role of miR-128 in tumors has not been fully characterized. In the present study, cell adhesion assays indicated that overexpression of miR-128 can promote cell-cell adhesion. Target site prediction algorithms indicated that miR-128 binds the 3'-untranslated regions of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor (Eph)B1 and EphB2 mRNAs. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-128 binds and regulates EphB1 and EphB2 mRNAs. Overexpression of EphB2 reduced the ability of miR-128 to promote cell-cell adhesion. The wound-healing assay indicated that miR-128 significantly inhibited cell migration via EphB2. This study revealed the novel functions of miR-128 in cell-cell adhesion and cell migration in glioma cells through the regulation of EphB2, and identified EphB1 and EphB2 as novel miR-128 targets.
