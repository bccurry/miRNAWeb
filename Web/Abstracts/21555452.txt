A hypoxia-induced positive feedback loop promotes hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha stability through miR-210 suppression of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like. Oxygen-dependent regulation of the transcription factor HIF-1 relies on a family of prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) that hydroxylate hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) protein at two prolines during normal oxygen conditions, resulting in degradation by the proteasome. During low-oxygen conditions, these prolines are no longer hydroxylated and HIF-1 degradation is blocked. Hypoxia-induced miRNA-210 (miR-210) is a direct transcriptional target of HIF-1, but its complete role and targets during hypoxia are not well understood. Here, we identify the enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like (GPD1L) as a novel regulator of HIF-1 stability and a direct target of miR-210. Expression of miR-210 results in stabilization of HIF-1 due to decreased levels of GPD1L resulting in an increase in HIF-1 target genes. Altering GPD1L levels by overexpression or knockdown results in a decrease or increase in HIF-1 stability, respectively. GPD1L-mediated decreases in HIF-1 stability can be reversed by pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome or PHD activity. When rescued from degradation by proteasome inhibition, elevated amounts of GPD1L cause hyperhydroxylation of HIF-1, suggesting increases in PHD activity. Importantly, expression of GPD1L attenuates the hypoxic response, preventing complete HIF-1 induction. We propose a model in which hypoxia-induced miR-210 represses GPD1L, contributing to suppression of PHD activity, and increases of HIF-1 protein levels.
