microrna expression signature of gastric cancer cells relative to normal gastric mucosa. micrornas (miRNAs) play an important role in a wide range of physiological and developmental processes by negatively regulating the expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we investigated the differential miRNA expression signature between gastric cancer cells and normal gastric mucosa to determine changes in miRNA expression during gastric cancer development. We analyzed the global miRNA expression profiles of 9 gastric cancer cell lines and 6 normal gastric mucosa lines using miRNA microarrays. In addition, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) to validate the results. Correlations between the miRNA expression profile and tumor clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. We found that 17 miRNAs were upregulated in gastric cancer cell lines and 146 miRNAs were downregulated compared to normal gastric mucosa. Using microarray data and Q-PCR validation, 15 miRNAs were finally selected. These candidate miRNAs were associated with gastric cancer clinicopathology to various degrees. High expression levels of hsa-miR-93 were found to predict poor survival (median, 16 vs. 40 months; log-rank test p&lt;0.05). These findings suggest that miRNAs play vital roles in human gastric cancer. The findings may also provide clues toward understanding the molecular functions of miRNAs in various biological processes.
