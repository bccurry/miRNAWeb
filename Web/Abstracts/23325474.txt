MicroRNAs in metabolic disease. Alterations in the metabolic control of lipid and glucose homeostasis predispose an individual to develop cardiometabolic diseases, such as type 2-diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. Work over the last years has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in regulating these physiological processes. The contribution of miRNAs in regulating metabolism is exemplified by miR-33, an intronic miRNA encoded in the Srebp genes. miR-33 controls cellular cholesterol export and fatty acid degradation, whereas its host genes stimulate cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Other miRNAs, such as miR-122, also play a critical role in regulating lipid homeostasis by controlling cholesterol synthesis and lipoprotein secretion in the liver. This review article summarizes the recent findings in the field, highlighting the contribution of miRNAs in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism. We will also discuss how the modulation of specific miRNAs may be a promising strategy to treat metabolic diseases.
