[MiR26a and miR939 regulate the replication of H1N1 influenza virus in MDCK cell]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the process of infection and replication of virus in host cells. In this study, we cloned two miRNAs expression vectors and examined their effects on the replication of H1N1 type influenza virus in MDCK (Madin dardy canine kidney) cells. We constructed the plasmids expressing miR26a and miR939 and performed the transfection study in MDCK cells. Subsequently, the cells were infected with H1N1 type influenza virus 24 h after transfection. Then we tested the hemagglutination titer at 72 h time point to investigate the effect of miR26a and miR939 on the replication H1N1 type influenza virus in MDCK cells. The transfection study showed that miR26a and miR939 can achieve efficiently expression in MDCK cells. miR26a and miR939 can influence the replication of H1N1 influenza virus differently in two different ways. miR26a inhibits the replication, whereas miR939 stimulates the process. Cellular miRNAs can regulate the replication of H1N1 influenza virus in host cells, and our paper should report the role of miR26a and miR939 in this regulation for the first time.
