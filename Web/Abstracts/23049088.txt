A genome-wide association study provides evidence for association of chromosome 8p23 (MYP10) and 10q21.1 (MYP15) with high myopia in the French Population. Myopia is a complex trait affected by both genetic and environmental factors. High myopia is associated with increased risk of sight threatening eye disorders such as retinal detachment. The purpose of this genome-wide association study was to identify susceptibility genes contributing to high myopia in the French population. High myopic cases were genotyped using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 chips and population controls were selected from the GABRIEL French dataset, in which samples were genotyped by Illumina Human610 quad array. The association study was conducted using 152,234 single nucleotide polymorphisms that were present on both manufacturers' chips in 192 high myopic cases and 1064 controls to identify associated regions. Imputation was performed on peak regions. Associations were found at known myopia locus MYP10 on chromosome 8p23 and MYP15 on chromosome 10q21.1. Rs189798 (8p23), and rs10825992 (10q21.1) showed the strongest associations in these regions (P = 6.32  10(-7) and P = 2.17  10(-5), respectively). The imputed results at 8p23 showed two peaks of interest. The first spanned 30 kb including rs189798 between MIR4660 and PPP1R3B with the most significant association at rs17155227 (P = 1.07  10(-10)). The second novel peak was 4 kb in length, encompassing MIR124-1 and the MSRA gene, with the strongest association at rs55864141 (P = 1.30  10(-7)). The peak of imputed data at 10q21.1 was 70 kb in length between ZWINT and MIR3924, with rs3107503 having the lowest P value (P = 1.54  10(-7)). We provide evidence for the association of MYP10 at 8p23 and MYP15 at 10p21.1 with high myopia in the French population and refine these regions of association.
