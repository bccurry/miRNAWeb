MicroRNA-146a regulates the maturation process and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by targeting CD40L in oxLDL-stimulated dendritic cells. There is increasing evidence that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation that accompany inflammatory responses. However, whether miRNAs are associated with dendritic cell (DC) immuno-inflammatory responses to oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) stimulation is yet unknown. Our study aims to explore the link of miRNA to lipid-overload and the immuno-inflammatory mechanism for atherosclerosis. Human primary monocyte-derived DCs were transfected with miR-146a mimics and inhibitor, and then stimulated by oxLDL. For the flow cytometric analysis of the DC immunophenotype, supernatants were collected to determine inflammatory chemokine markers. Our study clearly revealed that miRNA-146a regulates the maturation process and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in DCs by targeting CD40L in ox-LDL-stimulated DCs.
