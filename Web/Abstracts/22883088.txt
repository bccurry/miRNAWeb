[Association study on the microRNA-1 target gene polymorphism and the risk of premature coronary artery disease]. To investigate the association between the genetic variant of miRNA-1 target gene COG6 rs9548934 CT and the risk of premature coronary artery disease (pCAD). This study included 226 pACD patients and 275 gender and age matched pCAD-free controls hospitalized in our hospital, diagnosis was made based on coronary angiography (CAG) results. The genotypes of miRNA-1 target gene COG6 rs9548934 CT were detected by PCR-RFLP. Compared with the wide genotype CC, subjects with the variant genotypes CT of rs9548934 CT was associated with a 45% lower risk of pACD (adjusted OR = 0.55, 95%CI = 0.36 - 0.82, P = 0.003), and the subjects with CT/TT genotypes were also associated with a significantly lower risk of pACD (adjusted OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.44 - 0.92, P = 0.015). Using the median serum TG level (1.20 mmol/L) in control group as the cutoff value, subjects with higher serum TG levels were associated with increased risk of pACD after adjustment for age, gender and BMI (adjusted OR = 2.32, 95%CI = 1.57 - 3.41, P &lt; 0.001). In addition, subjects with higher HDL-C levels were associated with significantly lower risk of pACD (adjusted OR = 0.48, 95%CI = 0.31 - 0.75, P = 0.001). Stratified analyses showed that the risk reduction for pCAD in CT/TT genotypes carriers was more significant in the female subjects (adjusted OR = 0.54, 95%CI = 0.30 - 0.97, P = 0.040), and in subjects with lower TG, TC, HDL-C and LDL-C levels (adjusted OR = 0.62, 95%CI = 0.39 - 0.98, P = 0.040; adjusted OR = 0.55, 95%CI = 0.35 - 0.85, P = 0.008; adjusted OR = 0.43, 95%CI = 0.22 - 0.87, P = 0.018; adjusted OR = 0.49, 95%CI = 0.32 - 0.75, P = 0.001, respectively). The polymorphism of miRNA-1 target gene COG6 rs9548934CT is associated with lower risk of pCAD, especially in female subjects and subjects with lower serum lipid levels.
