MicroRNA-183 regulates Ezrin expression in lung cancer cells. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. However, the mechanism of lung cancer relapse and metastasis has been poorly elucidated. Recent researches have addressed the role of MicroRNAs (miRNAs) in mediating tumor metastasis. In the present study, we identified microRNA-183 (miR-183) as a potential metastasis-inhibitor. Expression level of miR-183 was reversely correlated with the metastatic potential of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-183 inhibited migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, we identified VIL2-coding-protein Ezrin as a bona fide target of miR-183. We also found that miR-183 could regulate the expression of other genes involved in migration and invasion. Taken together, our findings demonstrated a new role and regulatory mechanism of miR-183 in controlling cancer metastasis.
