A one-two punch of miR-126/126* against metastasis. MicroRNAs regulate cancer metastasis by modulating both the intrinsic properties of tumour cells and their interactions with the tumour stroma. Both strands of the miR-126/miR-126* duplex are now shown to simultaneously target the Sdf-1 cytokine to reduce the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells and inflammatory monocytes to primary tumours, thereby inhibiting lung metastasis.
