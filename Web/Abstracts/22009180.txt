A cluster of specified microRNAs in peripheral blood as biomarkers for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer by stem-loop RT-PCR. To investigate the levels for some specified microRNAs in human's peripheral blood so as to determine whether they can serve as biomarkers for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Use a quantitative stem-loop RT-PCR method to examine the serum levels for certain microRNAs including has-miR-125a-5p, has-miR-126, has-miR-183, has-miR-200, has-miR-221, and has-miR-222 from the patients with Stage IV, Stage I/II non-small-cell lung cancer and the controls. There was statistical difference in the serum levels for hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-183, and hsa-miR-222 between the controls and the Stage IV patients, but not for has-miR-125a-5p, has-miR-200 and has-miR-221. It also showed statistical difference for hsa-miR-126 and hsa-miR-183 between the Stage I/II patients and Stage IV patients, but not between the controls and Stage I/II patients. Hsa-miR-126 and hsa-miR-183 may serve as potential serum biomarkers for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.
