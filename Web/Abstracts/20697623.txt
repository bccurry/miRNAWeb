Modulation of microRNA function by synthetic ribozymes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are now recognized as one of the major class of gene regulatory molecules in eukaryotic cells. Aberrant miRNA expression has been implicated in many human diseases. Herein, we exploit the site-specific cleavage ability of hammerhead ribozymes to design synthetic ribozymes and establish that they can cleave miRNA, thereby inhibiting miRNA function. We also used modified ribozymes where a 3'-3'-linked nucleotide &quot;cap&quot; (inverted T) was added and few ribonucleotides were changed to 2'-O-methyl nucleotides. The modified ribozyme was more efficient at inhibiting miR-21 than the wild type ribozyme.
