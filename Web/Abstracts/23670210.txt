microRNA-330 inhibits cell motility by downregulating Sp1 in prostate cancer cells. microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs, have emerged as key regulators of a large number of genes. The present study aimed to explore novel biological functions of miR-330 in the human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3. We confirmed that miR-330 was downregulated and inversely correlated with specificity protein 1 (Sp1) expression. Overexpression of miR-330 by transfection of a chemically synthesized miR-330 mimic induced a reduction in expression levels of the Sp1 protein, accompanied by significant suppression of cellular migration and invasion capability. In addition, the Sp1-knockdown experiments presented similar phenomena. Finally, the luciferase reporter assay validated Sp1 as the direct target of miR-330. These findings indicate that miR-330 acts as an anti-metastatic miRNA in prostate cancer.
