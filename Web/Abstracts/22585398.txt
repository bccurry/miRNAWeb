miR-9 enhances IL-2 production in activated human CD4(+) T cells by repressing Blimp-1. The fast production of effector cytokines, such as IL-2, is essential for the autocrine function in the rapid activation of naive CD4(+) T cells. Here, we show that the microRNA (miRNA) pathway plays an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human CD4(+) T cells. miRNAs are small non-coding molecules that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs. Using microarray- and deep sequencing approaches, we detected an increase in the abundance of miR-9 in activated human CD4(+) T cells. To determine the impact of miR-9 on immune responses, we analyzed its effect on two putative target genes, PRDM1, which encodes for the transcription factor Blimp-1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1), and Bcl-6 (B cell lymphoma-6 protein). Suppression of miR-9 led to increased expression of PRDM1 and Bcl-6, which subsequently resulted in diminished secretion of IL-2 and IFN-. Our data provide evidence that the abundance of Blimp-1, and consequently the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, is regulated in two ways: (1) transcriptional regulation by activation of CD4(+) T cells and (2) post-transcriptional regulation by enhanced miR-9 expression.
