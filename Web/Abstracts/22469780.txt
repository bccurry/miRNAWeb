B-cell regulator of immunoglobulin heavy chain transcription (Bright)/ARID3a is a direct target of the oncomir microRNA-125b in progenitor B-cells. B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is often associated with chromosomal translocations leading to the deregulation of proto-oncogenes. MicroRNAs can also be affected by chromosomal alterations and thus contribute to carcinogenesis. The microRNA miR-125b-1 is over-expressed in B-ALL cases with the t(11;14)(q24;q34) translocation, therefore we sought to determine the role of this microRNA in B-cell fate. We used murine pre-BI cells alongside murine and human leukemic B-cell lines to show that miR-125b expression enhances proliferation by targeting Bright/ARID3a, an activator of immunoglobulin heavy-chain transcription. Accordingly, this target gene was down-regulated in B-ALL patients with the t(11;14)(q24;q34) translocation. Repression of Bright/ARID3A blocked differentiation and conferred a survival advantage to Ba/F3 cells under IL3 starvation. In addition, over-expression of miR-125b protected pre-BI and leukemic B-cell lines from apoptosis through blockade of caspase activation via a mechanism that was independent of p53 and BAK1. In summary, miR-125b can act as an oncogene in B-ALL by targeting ARID3a and mediating its repression, thus leading to a blockage in differentiation, increased proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 3 April 2012; doi:10.1038/leu.2012.95.
