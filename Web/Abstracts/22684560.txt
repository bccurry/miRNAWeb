MicroRNA-34a inhibits human brain glioma cell growth by down-regulation of notch1. The effects of microRNA-34a (miR-34a)-regulated Notch1 gene on the proliferation and apoptosis of the human glioma cell line U87 were investigated in this study. The U87 cells were divided into miR-34a mimics, negative control, mock transfection and blank control groups in terms of different treatments. In miR-34a mimics group, human U87 glioma cells were transfected with miR-34a mimics by using lipofectamine 2000. The cells transfected with nonsense microRNA were set up as negative control group. Those treated with lipofectamine 2000 only were designated to the mock tranfection group. In the blank control group, the cells were cultured routinely and no treatment was given. The expression of miR-34a and Notch1 was detected by using real-time RT-PCR. Western blotting was employed to monitor the change in Notch1 protein. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. The results showed that the proliferative ability of U87 cells was significantly reduced and the apoptotic cells increased in miR-34a mimics group relative to control groups. The expression of miR-34a was significantly up-regulated in mimics group as compared with control groups (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, Notch1 protein levels were significantly decreased in miR-34a mimics group when compared with control groups (P&lt;0.05), but the mRNA expression of Notch1 showed no significant difference among these groups. It was concluded that miR-34a may suppress the proliferation and induce apoptosis of U87 cells by decreasing the expression of target gene Notch1, suggesting that miR-34a may become a promising gene therapeutic target for brain glioma.
