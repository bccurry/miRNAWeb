Expression of microRNA 210 associates with poor survival and age of tumor onset of soft-tissue sarcoma patients. Expression of microRNAs can affect age of tumor onset and prognosis of cancer patients. However, nothing is known about the effects of microRNAs on altered age of cancer onset and disease-specific survival of soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients. The levels of miR-210, also known as hypoxia-regulated microRNA, were analyzed by quantitative real-time (RT)-PCR in the tumors of 78 STS patients. The patients were stratified according to their microRNA levels with low, intermediate and high expression levels and the association of microRNA expression and patients' survival was analyzed using multivariate Cox's regression hazard analyses. A significant correlation between an intermediate miR-210 expression and disease-specific death of STS patients [relative risk (RR) = 3.19; p = 0.018] was observed compared with patients with high expression levels in their tumors. Interestingly, the association between an intermediate expression of miR-210 and a poor prognosis was only significant in female STS patients (RR = 11.28; p = 0.010), but not observed in male individuals. Furthermore, the expression of miR-210 showed a significant association with the age of tumor onset in a gender-specific manner. Specifically, male patients with an intermediate expression of miR-210 associated with a 9.6-year later age of tumor onset (p = 0.017) compared with males with a low expression of miR-210 in their tumors. However, no significant differences in the female patients were observed. This study provides the first evidence of a correlation of expression levels of a single microRNA (miR-210) with the prognosis and age of tumor onset in a gender-specific manner in STS patients.
