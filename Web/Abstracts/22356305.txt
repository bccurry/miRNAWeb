Validation of the isolation and quantification of kidney enriched miRNAs for use as biomarkers. MiRNAs have been reported to represent sensitive and translational biomarkers of organ injury. To validate the methodologies for the isolation and quantification of a miRNAs from none-invasive biofluids. Commercially available miRNA isolation kits and qPCR was utilised for determination of analyte sensitivity, stability, recovery, and precision. qPCR was highly precise and sensitive for endogenous miRNA quantification (miR-194, LLQ; 0.1 pM). Intra and inter-assay variation remained low (&lt;12%). Variable recovery (54-89%) was controlled for by internal synthetic standards (C. elegans Lin-4). Translational endogenous miRNAs reflective of renal injury represent stable analytes with a large dynamic range that can be quantified easily in most laboratories.
