Therapeutic effects of microRNA-582-5p and -3p on the inhibition of bladder cancer progression. Many reports have indicated that the abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is associated with the progression of disease and have identified miRNAs as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. However, the bifunctional mechanisms of miRNA guide and passenger strands in RNA interference (RNAi) therapy have not yet been clarified. Here, we show that miRNA (miR)-582-5p and -3p, which are strongly decreased in high-grade bladder cancer clinical samples, regulate tumor progression in vitro and in vivo. Significantly, the overexpression of miR-582-5p or -3p reduced the proliferation and invasion of UM-UC-3 human bladder cancer cells. Furthermore, transurethral injections of synthetic miR-582 molecule suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in an animal model of bladder cancer. Most interestingly, our study revealed that both strands of miR-582-5p and -3p suppressed the expression of the same set of target genes such as protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I beta subunit (PGGT1B), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and DIX domain containing 1 (DIXDC1). Knockdown of these genes using small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in the inhibition of cell growth and invasiveness of UM-UC-3. These findings uncover the unique regulatory pathway involving tumor suppression by both strands of a single miRNA that is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of invasive bladder cancer.
