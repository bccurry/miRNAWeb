Cellular oncomiR orthologue in EBV oncogenesis. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at multiple levels. The discovery of virally encoded miRNAs attracted immense attention towards their role in viral replication and pathogenesis. Kaposi's-sarcoma-associated herpes virus encodes miRNA that functions as an orthologue of human cellular miRNA, i.e., hsa-miR-155. Keeping the same view we extended the miRNA-homology search between the miRNAs of humans and Epstein-Barr virus. The In silico analyses shows that EBV encoded miR-BART-5 has a significant 'seed' sequence homology to hsa-miR-18 of humans. Further, the mRNA transcripts of the human genes involved in cellular growth could potentially be targeted by both viral as well as human miRNAs. The known etiological role of hsa-miR-18 as an oncomiR suggests that miR-BART-5 may function as viral oncomiR as observed in EBV-positive gastric carcinoma patients.
