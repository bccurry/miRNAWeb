Lab in a tube: ultrasensitive detection of microRNAs at the single-cell level and in breast cancer patients using quadratic isothermal amplification. Through rational design of a functional molecular probe with high sequence specificity that takes advantage of sensitive isothermal amplification with simple operation, we developed a one-pot hairpin-mediated quadratic enzymatic amplification strategy for microRNA (miRNA) detection. Our method exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity toward miR-21 with detection limits of 10 fM at 37 C and 1 aM at 4 C, which corresponds to nine strands of miR-21 in a 15 L sample, and it is capable of distinguishing among miRNA family members. More importantly, the proposed approach is also sensitive and selective when applied to crude extractions from MCF-7 and PC3 cell lines and even patient tissues from intraductal carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.
