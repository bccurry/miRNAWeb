The Hsa-miR-27a rs895819 (A&gt;G) polymorphism and cancer susceptibility. Published data on the association between the rs895819 (A&gt;G) polymorphism in the terminal loop of pre-miR-27a and cancer risk is inconclusive. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the association between this polymorphism and cancer. The PubMed, Web of science, and Embase databases were searched for articles on the hsa-miR-27a rs895819 polymorphism and cancer risk published up to November 24, 2012. The genotype data obtained in the searches were pooled in our meta-analysis, and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association. Seven studies with a total of 3849 cases and 4781 controls were eligible for analysis. Overall, we found no significant associations between the hsa-miR-27a rs895819 (A&gt;G) polymorphism and cancer susceptibility (homozygote model: OR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.68-1.14; heterozygote model: OR=0.96, 95% CI: 0.79-1.17; dominant model: OR=0.94, 95% CI: 0.79-1.12; recessive model: OR=0.88, 95% CI: 0.69-1.12). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, we found that the rs895819 AG genotype was associated with a decreased risk of cancer in white individuals (dominant model: OR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.76-0.94; heterozygote model: OR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.75-0.94). This meta-analysis indicated that the hsa-miR-27a rs895819 polymorphism did not correlate with overall cancer risk in the general population. However, the rs895819 AG genotype may protect against the development of cancer in white individuals. Larger, better studies of homogeneous cancer patients are needed to further assess the correlation between this polymorphism and cancer risk.
