Role of miR-21 in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrosis. Atrial fibrosis is important for the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF) but the underlying signal transduction is incompletely understood. We therefore studied the role of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and its downstream target Sprouty 1 (Spry1) during atrial fibrillation. Left atria (LA) from patients with AF showed a 2.5-fold increased expression of miR-21 compared to matched LA of patients in sinus rhythm. Increased miR-21 expression correlated positively with atrial collagen content and was associated with a reduced protein expression of Spry1 and increased expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), lysyl oxidase and Rac1-GTPase. Neonatal cardiac fibroblasts treated with angiotensin II (AngII) or CTGF showed an increased miR-21 and decreased Spry1 expression. Pretreatment with an inhibitor of Rac1 GTPase, NSC23766, reduced the AngII-induced upregulation of miR-21. A small molecule inhibitor of lysyl oxidase, BAPN, prevented the AngII as well as the CTGF-induced miR-21 expression. Transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of Rac1, which develop spontaneous AF and atrial fibrosis with increasing age, showed upregulation of miR-21 expression associated with reduced Spry1 expression. miR-21 expression and signalling in vivo were prevented by long-term treatment of the mice with statins. Direct inhibition of miR-21 by antagomir-21 prevented fibrosis of the atrial myocardium post-myocardial infarction. Left atria of patients with atrial fibrillation are characterized by upregulation of miR-21 und reduced expression of Spry1. Activation of Rac1 by angiotensin II leads to a CTGF- and lysyl oxidase-mediated increase of miR-21 expression contributing to structural remodelling of the atrial myocardium.
