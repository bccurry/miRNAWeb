Human microRNA hsa-miR-296-5p suppresses enterovirus 71 replication by targeting the viral genome. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as a major cause of neurological disease following the near eradication of poliovirus. Accumulating evidence suggests that mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding RNAs of 18 to 23 nucleotides (nt) with important regulatory roles in many cellular processes, participate in host antiviral defenses. However, the roles of miRNAs in EV71 infection and pathogenesis are still unclear. Here, hsa-miR-296-5p expression was significantly increased in EV71-infected human cells. As determined by virus titration, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and Western blotting, overexpression of hsa-miR-296-5p inhibited, while inhibition of endogenous hsa-miR-296-5p facilitated, EV71 infection. Additionally, two potential hsa-miR-296-5p targets (nt 2115 to 2135 and nt 2896 to 2920) located in the EV71 genome (strain BrCr) were bioinformatically predicted and validated by luciferase reporter assays and Western blotting. Genomic alignment of various EV71 strains revealed synonymous mutations in hsa-miR-296-5p target sequences. Furthermore, the introduction of synonymous mutations into the EV71 BrCr genome by site-directed mutagenesis impaired the viral inhibitory effects of hsa-miR-296-5p and facilitated mutant virus infection. Meanwhile, compensatory mutations in corresponding hsa-miR-296-5p target sequences of the EV71 HeN strain (GenBank accession number JN256064) restored the inhibitory effects of the miRNA. These results indicate that hsa-miR-296-5p inhibits EV71 replication by targeting the viral genome. Our findings support the notion that cellular miRNAs can inhibit virus infection and that the virus mutates to escape suppression by cellular miRNAs.
