MiR-21 is involved in cervical squamous cell tumorigenesis and regulates CCL20. MicroRNA 21 (miR-21) has been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis. However, its function and molecular mechanism in cervical squamous carcinoma have not been studied. Using TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR and Northern blot, we confirmed that miR-21 is significantly overexpressed in human cervical squamous cancer tissues and cell lines. Remarkably, we showed that the level of miR-21 correlates with the tumor differentiation and nodal status by ISH. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-21 regulates proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of HPV16-positive cervical squamous cells. In order to identify candidate target genes for miR-21, we used gene expression profiling. By luciferase reporter assays, we confirmed that CCL20 is one of its target genes, which is related to the HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes. Our results suggest that miR-21 may be involved in cervical squamous cell tumorigenesis.
