[Transcriptomic regulation and molecular mechanism of polygenic tumor at different stages]. The research team on the National Key Scientific Program of China: &quot;Transcriptomic regulation and molecular mechanism research of polygenic tumor at different stages&quot; has focused on the field of transcriptomics of 4 common polygenic tumors, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC), breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and glioma. Extensive laboratory work has been carried out on the expression and regulation of tumor transcriptomics; identification of tumor suppressor/susceptible genes; mechanism of tumor epigenetics including miRNAs, and comparative study of specific gene/protein cluster of tumor transcriptomics and proteomics. Genes including SPLUNC1, LTF, BRD7, NOR1, BRCA1/2, PALB2, AF1Q, SOX17, NGX6, SOX7, and LRRC4 have been identified as the key transcriptional regulation genes during the stage of tumor initiation and invasion. Accordingly,the NPC gene signal regulation network of &quot;SPLUNC1-miR-141-target genes&quot;, the breast cancer interaction signal pathway of &quot;miR-193b-uPA&quot;,the glioma signal network of &quot;miR-381- LRRC4-MEK/ERK/AKT&quot;, and the miRNA-target gene network of colorectal cancer metastasis related gene NGX6 have been thoroughly elucidated. These fruitful Results imply that the changes of key molecules in crucial signal pathway will cause severe dysfunction in signal transduction and gene regulation network in polygenic tumors, indicating that in the category of pathogenesis,these tumors may further classify as the &quot;Disease of gene signal transduction and gene regulation network disorder&quot;. The researches have laid solid foundation for revealing the molecular mechanism and transcriptomic regulation of polygenic tumors at different stages.
