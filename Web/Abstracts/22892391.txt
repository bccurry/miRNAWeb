MicroRNA-204 increases sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to cisplatin and is associated with a favourable clinical outcome. Neuroblastoma remains a major cause of cancer-linked mortality in children. miR-204 has been used in microRNA expression signatures predictive of neuroblastoma patient survival. The aim of this study was to explore the independent association of miR-204 with survival in a neuroblastoma cohort, and to investigate the phenotypic effects mediated by miR-204 expression in neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma cell lines were transiently transfected with miR-204 mimics and assessed for cell viability using MTS assays. Apoptosis levels in cell lines were evaluated by FACS analysis of Annexin V-/propidium iodide-stained cells transfected with miR-204 mimics and treated with chemotherapy drug or vehicle control. Potential targets of miR-204 were validated using luciferase reporter assays. miR-204 expression in primary neuroblastoma tumours was predictive of patient event-free and overall survival, independent of established known risk factors. Ectopic miR-204 expression significantly increased sensitivity to cisplatin and etoposide in vitro. miR-204 direct targeting of the 3' UTR of BCL2 and NTRK2 (TrkB) was confirmed. miR-204 is a novel predictor of outcome in neuroblastoma, functioning, at least in part, through increasing sensitivity to cisplatin by direct targeting and downregulation of anti-apoptotic BCL2. miR-204 also targets full-length NTRK2, a potent oncogene involved with chemotherapy drug resistance in neuroblastoma.
