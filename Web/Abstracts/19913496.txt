Suppression of type I collagen production by microRNA-29b in cultured human stellate cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression through imperfect base pairing with the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of target mRNA. We studied the regulation of alpha 1 (I) collagen (Col1A1) expression by miRNAs in human stellate cells, which are involved in liver fibrogenesis. Among miR-29b, -143, and -218, whose expressions were altered in response to transforming growth factor-beta1 or interferon-alpha stimulation, miR-29b was the most effective suppressor of type I collagen at the mRNA and protein level via its direct binding to Col1A1 3'UTR. miR-29b also had an effect on SP1 expression. These results suggested that miR-29b is involved in the regulation of type I collagen expression by interferon-alpha in hepatic stellate cells. It is anticipated that miR-29b will be used for the regulation of stellate cell activation and lead to antifibrotic therapy.
