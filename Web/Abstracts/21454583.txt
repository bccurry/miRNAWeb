miRNA-205 suppresses melanoma cell proliferation and induces senescence via regulation of E2F1 protein. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by repressing translation or directing sequence-specific degradation of complementary mRNA. Here, we report that expression of miR-205 is significantly suppressed in melanoma specimens when compared with nevi and is correlated inversely with melanoma progression. miRNA target databases predicted E2F1 and E2F5 as putative targets. The expression levels of E2F1 and E2F5 were correlated inversely with that of miR-205 in melanoma cell lines. miR-205 significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of reporter plasmids containing the 3'-UTR sequences complementary to either E2F1 or E2F5. Overexpression of miR-205 in melanoma cells reduced E2F1 and E2F5 protein levels. The proliferative capacity of melanoma cells was suppressed by miR-205 and mediated by E2F-regulated AKT phosphorylation. miR-205 overexpression resulted in induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by increased cleaved caspase-3, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and cytochrome c release. Stable overexpression of miR-205 suppressed melanoma cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor cell growth in vivo and induced a senescence phenotype accompanied by elevated expression of p16INK4A and other markers for senescence. E2F1 overexpression in miR-205-expressing cells partially reversed the effects on melanoma cell growth and senescence. These results demonstrate a novel role for miR-205 as a tumor suppressor in melanoma.
