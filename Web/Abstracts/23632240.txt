Promoter polymorphisms of pri-miR-34b/c are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Numerous studies have focused on the association between miR-34 family members, which are direct p53 targets, and carcinogenesis of many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to assess whether polymorphisms in the single-nucleotide polymorphism miR-34b/c T&gt;C (rs4938723) and TP53 Arg72Pro (rs1042522) increase the risk of HCC and influence outcome in patients with HCC. We enrolled 157 HCC patients and 201 cancer-free control subjects from the Korean population. MicroRNA polymorphisms were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. We found that the miR-34b/c TC+CC frequency was significantly higher in HCC patients than in controls (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.580; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.029-2.426). The miR-34b/c CC-TP53 Arg/Arg combination significantly increased the risk of HCC (AOR: 13.644; 95% CI: 1.451-128.301). The SNPs miR-34b/c T&gt;C and TP53 Arg72Pro(G&gt;C) had no influence on survival of HCC patients. Our findings suggest that loss of the T allele in miR-34b/c T&gt;C, and the miR-34b/c CC-TP53 Arg/Arg combination increases the risk of HCC in the Korean population.
