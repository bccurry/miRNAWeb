Integrated profiling of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with 7q gain. To characterize diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with chromosome 7 gains, we combined clinical data with genomic, RNA and miRNA profiling. Gains were associated with age &gt;60 years, female gender, a trend for higher complete response rate, lower death rate, and better overall survival in patients treated with R-CHOP. Lesions were inversely associated with bone marrow involvement and number of extra-nodal sites. Differentially expressed transcripts were enriched of genes belonging to specific pathways and miRNAs targets. MIR96, MIR182, MIR589, MIR25 were shown significantly up-regulated in 7q+ DLBCL by real-time PCR.
