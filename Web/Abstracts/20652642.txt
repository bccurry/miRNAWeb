MicroRNA-203 expression as a new prognostic marker of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Detection of aberrant microRNA (miR) expression may contribute to diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between miR-203 expression and prognosis of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma after curative resection. A total of 113 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 20 samples of chronic pancreatitis, and 8 samples of normal pancreas were obtained. We investigated the association of miR-203 expression measured by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays with clinicopathological parameters and survival times. miR-203 was overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples compared with chronic pancreatitis (P &lt; 0.001) and normal pancreas (P = 0.001) samples. An association between miR-203 expression and clinicopathological factors of pancreatic adenocarcinoma was not observed. On univariate analysis, the high-miR-203 group and the subgroup (20%) of cases with the highest miR-203 overexpression had significantly shorter survival time (P = 0.048 and P = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that miR-203 expression was an independent predictor of poor prognosis in cases with no residual tumor (relative risk 2.298, P = 0.027). miR-203 expression is a new prognostic marker in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients.
