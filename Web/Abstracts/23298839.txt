Multiple functions of a glioblastoma fusion oncogene. RNA sequencing facilitates the discovery of novel gene fusions in cancer. In this issue of the JCI, Parker et al. identify an FGFR3-TACC3 fusion oncogene in glioblastoma and demonstrate a novel mechanism of pathogenicity. A miR-99a binding site within the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of FGFR3 is lost, releasing FGFR3 signaling from miR-99a-dependent inhibition and greatly enhancing tumor progression relative to WT FGFR3. These results provide compelling insight into the pathogenicity of a novel fusion oncogene and suggest new therapeutic approaches for a subset of glioblastomas.
