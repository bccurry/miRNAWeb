MicroRNA-mediated control of cell fate in megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors. Lineage specification is a critical issue in developmental and regenerative biology. We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNAs) are important participants in those processes and used the poorly understood regulation of megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) in hematopoiesis as a model system. We report here that miR-150 modulates lineage fate in MEPs. Using a novel methodology capable of profiling miRNA expression in small numbers of primary cells, we identify miR-150 as preferentially expressed in the megakaryocytic lineage. Through gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that miR-150 drives MEP differentiation toward megakaryocytes at the expense of erythroid cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we identify the transcription factor MYB as a critical target of miR-150 in this regulation. These experiments show that miR-150 regulates MEP fate, and thus establish a role for miRNAs in lineage specification of mammalian multipotent cells.
