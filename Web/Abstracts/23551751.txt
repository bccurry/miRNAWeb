MiR-139 Inhibits Mcl-1 Expression and Potentiates TMZ-Induced Apoptosis in Glioma. Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, is overexpressed in human glioblastoma, conferring a survival advantage to tumor cells. The mechanisms underlying its dysregulation have not been clarified. In this study, we explored the involvement of micro-RNAs that acted as endogenous sequence-specific suppressors of gene expression. Using computational and TCGA analysis, we identified miR-139 as being downregulated in glioblastoma in comparison with human brain tissue, as well as possessing a putative target site in Mcl-1 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-139 led to a clear decrease in Mcl-1 expression in gliomas. Reporter assays revealed direct post-transcriptional regulation involving miR-139 and the 3'-untranslated region of Mcl-1. Human glioma tissues with low expression of miR-139 displayed higher expression of Mcl-1 protein than those with high expression, suggesting that low miR-139 contributes to Mcl-1 overexpression. In addition, upregulation of miR-139 suppressed the proliferation and enhanced temozolomide (TMZ)-induced apoptosis. Finally, we observed that Mcl-1 knockdown resulted in similar effects compared with miR-139 transfection. Our results suggested that miR-139 negatively regulated Mcl-1 and induced apoptosis in cooperation with an anticancer drug TMZ in glioma.
