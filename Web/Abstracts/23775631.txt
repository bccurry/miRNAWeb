Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 reverses malignancy of hepatocellular carcinoma through regulating miR-134 in the DLK1-DIO3 region. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF4) is a dominant transcriptional regulator of hepatocyte differentiation and hepatocellular carcinogenesis. A previous study from this laboratory demonstrated striking suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by HNF4, although the mechanisms by which HNF4 reverses HCC malignancy are largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that HNF4 administration to HCC cells resulted in elevated levels of 28 mature miRNAs from the miR-379-656 cluster, which is located in the DLK1-DIO3 locus on human chromosome 14q32. Consistent with the reduction of HNF4, these miRNAs were downregulated in human HCC tissue. HNF4 regulated the transcription of the miR-379-656 cluster by directly binding to its response element in the DLK1-DIO3 region. Interestingly, several miRNAs in this cluster inhibited proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells in vitro. As a representative miRNA in this cluster, miR-134 exerted a dramatically suppressive effect on HCC malignancy by downregulating the onco-protein, KRAS. Moreover, miR-134 markedly diminished HCC tumorigenicity and displayed a significant antitumor effect in vivo. In addition, inhibition of endogenous miR-134 partially reversed the suppressive effects of HNF4 on KRAS expression and HCC malignancy. Furthermore, a positive correlation between HNF4 and miR-134 levels was observed during hepatocarcinogenesis in rats, and decreases in miR-134 levels were significantly associated with the aggressive behaviors of human HCCs. Conclusion: Our data highlight the importance of the miR-379-656 cluster in the inhibitory effect of HNF4 on HCC, and suggest that regulation of the HNF4-miRNA cascade may have beneficial effects in the treatment of HCC.
