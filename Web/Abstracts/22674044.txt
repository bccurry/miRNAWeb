Inhibiting wipf2 down regulation by transgenic expression of its 3' mrna untranslated region improves cytotoxicity and vaccination response. Lymphocyte activation results in profound changes in the abundance of mRNA transcripts many of which are down regulated. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family is critical for productive T-cell receptor signaling and actin reorganization. The WASP signal pathway includes the Wiskott-Aldrich Interacting Family 2 (WIPF2) gene also known as WIRE/WICH. In both humans and mice, alternative splicing within the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) results in two major WIPF2 transcripts of approximately 4.5 and 6kB in size. Following T-cell activation, the level of human and mouse WIPF2 mRNA rapidly declines. In mice, this decline is accompanied by a marked reduction in WIPF2 protein levels. Transgenic expression of a 240 bp fragment derived from a highly conserved terminal 3'UTR found within the 6kB transcript blocks Wipf2 downregulation. These effects may be mediated by competitive inhibition of miRNA regulation since the 6kB derived transgene and the 4.5kB transcript share functional binding sites for miRNA146a. Blocking Wipf2 gene and protein repression resulted in improved T-cell responses to antigen immunization in vivo as well as in vitro cytotoxic T-cell killing. Collectively, these data suggest that early down regulation of this immunologically relevant gene controls the intensity of selective lymphocyte functions.
