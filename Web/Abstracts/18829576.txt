MicroRNA-21 targets a network of key tumor-suppressive pathways in glioblastoma cells. MicroRNA dysregulation is observed in different types of cancer. MiR-21 up-regulation has been reported for the majority of cancers profiled to date; however, knowledge is limited on the mechanism of action of miR-21, including identification of functionally important targets that contribute to its proproliferative and antiapoptotic actions. In this study, we show for the first time that miR-21 targets multiple important components of the p53, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and mitochondrial apoptosis tumor-suppressive pathways. Down-regulation of miR-21 in glioblastoma cells leads to derepression of these pathways, causing repression of growth, increased apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. These phenotypes are dependent on two of the miR-21 targets validated in this study, HNRPK and TAp63. These findings establish miR-21 as an important oncogene that targets a network of p53, TGF-beta, and mitochondrial apoptosis tumor suppressor genes in glioblastoma cells.
