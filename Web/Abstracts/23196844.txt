MyomiRs-133a/b turn off the heat. Brown adipose tissue is intensively researched owing to its role in regulating energy and glucose homeostasis. Its differentiation is controlled through adrenergic-dependent regulation of the transcriptional co-regulator Prdm16. Adrenergic stimulation inhibits expression of miR-133a/b in a Mef2c-dependent manner to abrogate post-transcriptional silencing of Prdm16.
