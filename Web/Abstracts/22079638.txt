MicroRNA-34a regulates migration of chondroblast and IL-1-induced degeneration of chondrocytes by targeting EphA5. MicroRNAs function as an endogenous mode of fine gene regulation and have been implicated in multiple differentiation and developmental processes. In the present study, we investigated the role of miRNA-34 during chondrogenic differentiation of chick limb mesenchymal cells. We found that the expression of miR-34a increased upon chondrogenic inhibition. Blockade of miR-34a via PNA-based antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) recovered the chondro-inhibitory actions of JNK inhibitor on migration of chondrogenic progenitors and the formation of precartilage condensation. Furthermore, we determined that EphA5 is a relevant target of miR-34a during chondrogenesis. MiR-34a was necessary and sufficient to down-regulate EphA5 expression, and up-modulation of EphA5 is sufficient to overcome inhibitory actions of miR-34 inhibition on cell migration and condensation of chick limb mesenchymal cells on collagen substrate. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-34a is a negative modulator of chondrogenesis, particularly in migration of chondroblasts, by targeting EphA5 and resulting inhibition of cellular condensation during chondrogenesis of chick limb mesenchymal cells.
