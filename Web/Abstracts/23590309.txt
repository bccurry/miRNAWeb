Changes in MicroRNA and mRNA expression with Differentiation of Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells. We studied the changes in expression of microRNAs and mRNA in normal human bronchial epithelial cells as they differentiate from an undifferentiated monolayer to a differentiated pseudostratified epithelium after 28 days of air/liquid interface (ALI) culture. After 28 days in ALI, the epithelial cells differentially expressed basal, ciliated and goblet cell markers. Using Affymetrix microarrays, 20 human miRNAs were found to be up-regulated while 35 miRNAs were found to be down-regulated in differentiated compared to undifferentiated cells. An analysis of changes in global mRNA expression revealed that 1201 probesets demonstrated an 8-fold change or greater at day 28 of ALI culture. Of these, 816 were up-regulated and 385 were down-regulated. With differentiation, miR-449a increased [fold change (FC), 38.15], and was related to changes in mRNA for Cell Division Cycle 25 Homologue A, CDC25A, (FC, 0.11). MiR -455 decreased (FC, 0.12) and was related to changes in mRNA for the epithelial cell marker, MUC1, (FC, 136). Transfection with antimiR-449 or miR-455-3p resulted in changes in target protein expression (CDC25A and MUC1, respectively) while transfection with reporter genes with 3'UTRs of these targets confirmed control of expression through that structure. Therefore, changes in specific miRNAs during human airway epithelial cell differentiation control gene and protein expression important for differentiation.
