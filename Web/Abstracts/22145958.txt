MicroRNA-223 expression is uniformly down-regulated in B cell lymphoproliferative disorders and is associated with poor survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. MicroRNA-223 (miR-223) expression has been demonstrated to be stage-specific in B cell differentiation and associated with the outcome of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, the expression pattern of miR-223 in B cell lymphoproliferative disorders and its association with the outcome of Chinese patients with CLL have not been investigated. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-223 expression was significantly decreased in CLL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL). In CLL, miR-223 expression decreased significantly with progression from early to advanced clinical stages and was significantly lower in patients with elevated (2)-microglobulin, unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgVH) gene or with disease progression or death. Using a cut-off determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis optimizing concordance with IgVH mutational status, miR-223-negative and -positive groups were defined for 22 and 31 patients, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival of the miR-223-negative group were 13 and 40 months, respectively, significantly shorter than for the miR-223-positive group (both not reached; p = 0.002 and p = 0.018, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that the absence of miR-223 was the only independent factor capable of predicting shorter PFS. In conclusion, miR-223 is uniformly down-regulated in B-LPDs and is a useful prognostic factor for patients with CLL.
