MicroRNA-24 inhibits osteosarcoma cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo by targeting LPAAT. Lysophosphatidic Acid Acyltransferase  (LPAAT) may be critically involved in osteosarcoma cell proliferation. However, the comprehensive mechanisms responsible for regulation of LPAAT in osteosarcoma cells remain unclear. This study found that enhanced LPAAT expression was correlated with osteosarcoma cell proliferation. MiR-24, targeted to LPAAT, was down-regulated in osteosarcoma cells. Overexpression of miR-24 down-regulated LPAAT expression in osteosarcoma cells. Specifically, overexpression of miR-24 inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation, however, such effect was blocked when LPAAT activity was inhibited. In conclusion, our study indicates that miR-24 is reduced in osteosarcoma cells, contributing to up-regulation of LPAAT and resultant osteosarcoma cell proliferation.
