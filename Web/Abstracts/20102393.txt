Function of microRNA-375 and microRNA-124a in pancreas and brain. In recent years, our understanding of how gene regulatory networks control cell physiology has improved dramatically. Studies have demonstrated that transcription is regulated not only by protein factors, but also by small RNA molecules, microRNAs (miRNAs). The first miRNA was discovered in 1993 as a result of a genetic screen for mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans. Since then, the use of sophisticated techniques and screening tools has promoted a more definitive understanding of the role of miRNAs in mammalian development and diseases. miRNAs have emerged as important regulators of genes involved in many biological processes, including development, cell proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis and metabolism. Over the last few years, the number of reviews dealing with miRNAs has increased at an impressive pace. In this review, we present general information on miRNA biology and focus more closely on comparing the expression, regulation and molecular functions of the two miRNAs, miR-375 and miR-124a. miR-375 and miR-124a share similar features; they are both specifically expressed in the pancreas and brain and directly bind a common target gene transcript encoding myotrophin, which regulates exocytosis and hormone release. Here, we summarize the available data obtained by our group and other laboratories and provide an overview of the specific molecular function of miR-375 and miR-124a in the pancreas and the brain, revealing a potential functional overlap for these two miRNAs and the emerging therapeutic potential of miRNAs in the treatment of human metabolic diseases.
