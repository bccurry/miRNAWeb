Direct serum assay for microRNA-21 concentrations in early and advanced breast cancer. MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs whose expression changes have been associated with cancer development and progression. Current techniques to isolate miRs for expression analysis from blood are inefficient. We developed a reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for direct detection of circulating miRs in serum. We hypothesized that serum concentrations of miR-21, a biomarker increased in breast tumors, would correlate with the presence and extent of breast cancer. The RT-qPCR applied directly in serum (RT-qPCR-DS) assay for circulating miR-21 was tested in sera from 102 patients with different stages of breast cancer and 20 healthy female donors. The assay was sensitive for detection of miR-21 in 0.625 L of serum from breast cancer patients. For differentiation of samples from patients with locoregional breast cancer from those from healthy donors, the odds ratio was 1.796 and the area under the curve was 0.721. In a multivariate analysis that included standard clinicopathologic prognostic factors, high circulating miR-21 concentrations correlated significantly (P &lt; 0.001) with visceral metastasis. A novel RT-qPCR-DS can improve the efficiency of miR assessment. Use of this assay to detect circulating miR-21 has diagnostic and prognostic potential in breast cancer.
