Inhibition of the miR-143/145 cluster attenuated neutrophil differentiation of APL cells. MicroRNAs can influence hematopoietic cell lineage commitment and aberrant expression of hematopoietic miRNAs contributes to AML pathology. We found that miR-143 and miR-145 expression is significantly repressed in primary AML patient samples as compared to neutrophils of healthy donors. Further analysis revealed impaired neutrophil differentiation of APL cells upon inhibition of miR-145 expression. Lastly, we identified p73 as transcriptional regulator of miR-143/145 during neutrophil differentiation of APL cells. Our data suggest that low miR-145 levels in APL, possibly due to aberrant expression of p73 transcription factors, contribute to the differentiation block seen in this disease.
